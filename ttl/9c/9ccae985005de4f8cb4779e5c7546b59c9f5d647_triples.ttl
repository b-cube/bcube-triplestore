    dc:description "This booklet has been prepared to meet the demand for and to take the place of Bulletins No. 65, Oil and Its Geology, and No. 69, Prospecting for Petroleum, issued by the Arizona Bureau of Mines four years ago, which have been out of stock nearly two years. Both bulletins were written by the junior author of this publication. While portions of the two old bulletins have been incorporated into this work, most of Part I has been abstracted with some modifications from an address delivered by the senior author on May 29, 1919, at El Paso. Texas, which was later published in the Arizona Mining Journal. No attempt has been made to write a manual for petroleum geologists; in fact, the end sought was merely to impress the general public with the fact that the accumulation and distribution of petroleum are governed by certain fairly well understood, but generally unknown or unappreciated, laws which only a welltrained and experienced geologist can satisfactorily apply. It was, therefore, deemed unnecessary and even undesirable to go into details or to discuss exceptions to and deviations from the general statements made. The reader who wishes to know \"the whole story\" is directed to the books on petroleum listed in the Bibliography. 45 p." ;
