    dc:description "In May of 2006, scientists from the Alaska Fisheries Science Centerparticipated in a pilot outreach program in Sand Point, Alaska. At the meetings,fishermen raised a number of concerns about the adequacy of walleye pollock(Theragra chalcogramma) assessment. The issues appeared to be related to the contrastingobservational scales of fishermen and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) scientistsresponsible for conducting assessment surveys and population modeling. NMFS resourceassessment surveys have a large spatial scale (i.e., the entire Gulf of Alaska) and occurinfrequently as they are biennial summer bottom trawl and acoustic-trawl surveys, with annualor biennial winter acoustic-trawl surveys targeting key spawningareas(von Szalay, et al. 2010; Guttormsen and Yasenak, 2007; Guttormsen and Jones, 2010).The stock assessment model for pollock estimates stock abundance for the central and westernGulf of Alaska (Dorn et al., 2011). In contrast, the observational scale of fishermen is spatiallyrestricted but temporally extensive, since they are on the water fishing throughout the year.Fishermen questioned whether NMFS assessment activities were appropriately designedto monitor the status of pollock in their area. They noted that additional surveysin different seasons and a more comprehensive acoustic-trawl survey effort in wintercould help address seasonal issues such as movement between spawning and feeding areas.Cooperative research projects with the Sand Point fishing community were identifiedas a potential approach for addressing some of these issues, but fishermen wantedthe assurance that their investment of time and effort will lead to improvementsin stock assessment. The acoustic-trawl surveys described in this report resultedfrom collaboration between NMFS scientists, the Aleutian East Borough, and localfishermen to address issues raised during the outreach program. Acoustic-trawlsurveys were conducted from a local fishing vessel in the western Gulf of Alaskaduring 2007-2011. To some extent, the surveys carried out during this period reflectedshifting program objectives. The initial objective was simply to demonstrate thefeasibility of using local fishing vessels to conduct acoustic-trawl surveys andto collect acoustic and biological information sufficient to estimate walleye pollockbiomass and spatial pattern. Once this was demonstrated, the focus of the project expandedto include other objectives. It is likely that the project will continue to evolvegiven continued funding for cooperative research. Specific objectives of the projectwere the following:Evaluate the feasibility of conducting acoustic-trawl surveysof pollock using local fishing vessels.Evaluate the quality of acoustic data collected from the Simrad ES60 echosounder.Evaluate the appropriateness of the design of the current NMFS acoustic-trawl surveysin the western Gulf of Alaska. Specific issues to be addressed included 1) transect densityin bathymetrically complex regions in the western Gulf of Alaska, 2) day/night differencesin pollock density, and 3) temporal variability of pollock density during replicate transects.Evaluate the timing of the NMFS survey (mid-February) in Sanak Troughby conducting a survey in January prior to the NMFS survey.Evaluate relationships between adult pollock density, young-of-the-year pollock density,euphausiid density, and the distribution of foraging humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae).This report summarizes the estimates of abundance and distribution of walleye pollockin areas covered by cooperative acoustic-trawl surveys conducted aboard a fishing vesselduring alternate Septembers and Januarys between 2007-2011 . It also summarizesphysical oceanographic and biological composition observations, initial findingsfrom ancillary data collections of marine mammal observations, and dual-frequencydifferencing techniques to discriminate different types of acoustic backsc" ;
