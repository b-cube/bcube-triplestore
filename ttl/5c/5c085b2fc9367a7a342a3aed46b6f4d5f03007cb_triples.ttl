    dc:description "UST_IDEM_IN is a point shapefile that contains regulated underground storage tank locations (including leaking underground storage tanks) in Indiana, provided by personnel of Indiana Department of Environmental Management, Office of Land Quality (IDEM, OLQ) as of August 16, 2002 and subsequently updated on January 14, 2003, July 11, 2003, June 3, 2004, January 4, 2005, April 25, 2005, July 27, 2006, January 24, 2007, June 4, 2009, April 16, 2010, and June 25, 2013. The data set provided by IDEM was in an ESRI geodatabase format and the feature class was named UST_SITES. UST_IDEM_IN is attributed with facility identifications, federal identification numbers, an attribute delineating which tanks are leaking, and addresses. Facility information and locational coordinates for state programs were provided by the Underground Tank Group within the Office of Land Quality, Indiana Department of Environmental Management. The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDEM, OLQ for the source shapefile named UST_SITES: \"The Underground Storage Tank (UST) program is responsible for registering all regulated underground storage tanks and assures that all regulated underground storage tanks meet Indiana's requirements for release detection, spill and overflow prevention and corrosion protection, and to insure that tanks not meeting those requirements are properly closed. The UST program also assures that these protection systems are operated and maintained properly. Regulated underground storage tanks are those USTs that have 10% or more of the tank and piping buried beneath the ground and contain a regulated substance, which includes either petroleum products or hazardous substances. Trained staff then went into the field and collected GPS information at managed sites as part of the daily inspection/management process. This information was then brought back to the office, processed, and QA/AC'd before being deposited in acentral archive.\"" ;
