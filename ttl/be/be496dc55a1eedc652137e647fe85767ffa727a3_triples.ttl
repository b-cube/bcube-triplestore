    dc:description "TIGER, TIGER/Line, and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau. ZCTA is a trademark of the U.S. Census Bureau. The 2002 TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER database. The TIGER/Line data are not in a mapping projection even though most of the features were scanned directly from source maps that were in a projection. The North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) is the coordinate datum used for the 48 contiguous states, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States. Regional datums are used for Hawaii and the Pacific Island Areas. The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries. A complete set of 2002 TIGER/Line files includes all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. The 2002 TIGER/Line files do not include a file for the Midway Islands. The Census TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation. The 2002 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The boundary information in the TIGER/Line files are for statistical data collection and tabulation purposes only; their depiction and designation for statistical purposes does not constitute a determination of jurisdictional authority or rights of ownership or entitlement. The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There are 19 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, and area boundaries. The 2002 TIGER/Line data dictionary contains a complete list of all the fields in the 19 record types." ;
