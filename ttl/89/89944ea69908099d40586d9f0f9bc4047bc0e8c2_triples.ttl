    dc:description "This LiDAR data is the result of private and government entities working together under the guidance of the International Water Institute (IWI) regarding the Red River Basin Mapping Initiative (RRBMI). The USACE St Louis District was one of the major contributors in this funding effort. Fugro Horizons Inc in cooperation with North West Geomatics, and Fugro EarthData acquired LiDAR with Leica sensor ALS50-II MPiA for the Red River Basin. The Red River Basin covers ND, MN, SD and flows into Canada. The US Red River Basin boundary covers 40,860 sq, with add-on counties is approximately 47,100 sq miles. Acquisition was planned between spring 2008 and Spring 2010. LiDAR sensor settings included acquisition at 8,000' AMT, 45 degree field of view, 6,626ft swath width, maximum along track spacing (occurs at FOV edge) of 2.56m in overlap areas, maximum cross track spacing (occurs at Nadir) 2.16 meter, average post spacing of 1.35m, point density (average) of 0.55 points per square meter, and area/point (average) of 1.82 m^2. This sensor was also equipped with IPAS inertial measuring unit (IMU) and a dual frequency airborne GPS receiver. Color film was acquired at 17,500' AMT and its accuracy can support 0.5m ortho photography. Final deliverables for the LiDAR are in UTM zone 14 coordinate system NAD83(CORS96) NAVD88 Geod03 meters tiled 2,000m x 2,000m with an XY naming convention. *******DELIVERABLES***** *** BareEarth - Contains bare earth class 2, keypoints class 8, and red river class 9.
