    dc:description "Sea floor mapping in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (NMS) is a cooperative effort of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, with technical support from the University of New Brunswick and the Canadian Hydrographic Service. The maps generated from this undertaking are based on a 1994-1996 survey that used a multibeam echo sounder to map 1,100 square nautical miles of the sea floor (fig. 1). The technology and methods of image acquisition and topographic contouring that were used are described in publication 4 in the References section. USGS Scientific Investigations Maps (SIM) 2840-A to -F constitute a six-map (twelve-sheet) series in digital (CD-ROM) format. The first three maps, SIM 2840-A, -B, and -C, were previously published on paper as USGS Geologic Investigations Series Maps I-2676-A, -B, and -C (publications 43-45 in the References). Preliminary versions of those three maps also had been released earlier on a CD-ROM as USGS Open-File Report 00-410 (publication 42). The map area shown here is a composite of 18 individual quadrangle maps (fig. 1). Two map series of the 18 quadrangles have been published at a scale of 1:25,000 and show sea floor topography (publications 4-22) and sun-illuminated sea floor topography (fig. 2; see publications 23-41). Sea floor maps, photographs, CD-ROMs, fact sheets, posters, and geographic names related to research conducted in the Stellwagen Bank NMS region are available online at USGS Web site http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/project-pages/stellwagen/index.html. See the References section for a numbered list of other publications. On the maps presented in this series, the locations of the corners of the 18 quadrangles are shown for reference as ticks labelled outside the map edges, and (on maps C and E) as large crossticks within the map area. Maps A, B, D, and F show the boundaries of the individual quadrangles. On the maps that show sun-illuminated sea floor topography, blank spaces represent areas of no data." ;
