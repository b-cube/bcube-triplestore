    dc:description "Over the past several years the researchers have conducted studies on the protected reef fish, goliath grouper (Epinephelus itajara). Goliath grouper has been overfished to the extent that the IUCN (World Conservation Union) has classified it as \"critically endangered\". The species was protected in the southeastern U.S. in 1990 through action by Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils and the National Marine Fisheries Service. Since that time there has been a steady recovery. The primary purpose of these goliath grouper studies was to provide an understanding of adult ecology and behavior so that the population could be managed sustainably. Investigations involved; 1) distribution throughout the southeastern U.S., 2) regional densities in Florida, 3) habitat characteristics, 4) movement patterns, 5) regional size distributions, 6) diet and trophic patterns, and 7) spawning biology. The autors found that the vast majority of the goliath grouper population of the southeastern U.S. is restricted to Florida waters, mostly south Florida. Population recovery began off southwest Florida in the area of abundant juvenile habitat, the Ten Thousand Islands, and expanded to the north and east to southeast Florida, especially off Palm Beach County where spawning aggregations now exist. Goliath grouper prefer high relief habitat with extensive holes and caves large enough to accommodate adults, except in coral reef habitat where population densities are relatively sparse. Except for spawning migrations they display strong site fidelity. Goliath grouper feed mostly on crabs (over 60% of the diet) and especially mud crabs and swimming crabs. Fishes dominating the diet are mostly sedentary species such as toadfish, boxfish, and burrfish. They are not apex predators, but instead feed at a relatively low trophic level, similar to that of pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides). According to the bioenergetics model adult goliath grouper food consumption per day is very low, but additional data are needed to reduce uncertainty. Spawning occurs in aggregations during the late summer through early fall (August through October). Night-time sounds produced by goliath grouper during this period (and no other) appear directly related to spawning and may be useful in determining spawning areas, spawning season, and frequency. The researchers confirmed night-time spawning by collecting goliath grouper eggs (verified genetically) in the late evening and early morning downstream from spawning aggregations during the last quarter moon in the Atlantic and during the new moon in the Gulf. Quantitative reef survey data on the regional population densities of goliath grouper in Florida was concordant with semi-quantitative Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF) data; this result will reduce uncertainty about the use of REEF's population density data for future stock assessments." ;
