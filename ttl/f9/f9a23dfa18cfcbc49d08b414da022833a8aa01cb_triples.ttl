    dc:description "Requests for information about the metal production of Arizona are continually being received by the Arizona Bureau of Mines. It is in answer to this insistent demand that the data contained in this bulletin have been compiled. The assembled data and information are as comprehensive as it is possible to make them. The total metal production of Arizona has been subdivided and segregated in numerous ways. A start is made by showing the annual production, since 1858,of each of the major metals in pounds or ounces and also in dollars. Each of these metals is then segregated into the kind of ore from which it has been produced, as far back as the records are available. The content in pounds or ounces and in dollars for each kind of ore is also given. The entire production of the state is then allocated to the different counties in pounds or ounces and dollars. The county figures are annual from 1900 to 1934 and combined for the period prior to 1900. To as far back as the information is available, the production of mining districts in each county is given. The mining district production is then shown by mines. In other tables the annual production since 1907 has been shown by methods of recovery. Tables also show the kinds of mines and the operating milling plants and other data relating to ore production. 112 p." ;
