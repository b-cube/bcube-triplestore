    dc:description "The once-a-decade decennial census was conducted in April 2010 by the U.S. Census Bureau. This count of every resident in the United States was mandated by Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution and all households in the U.S. and individuals living in group quarters were required by law to respond to the 2010 Census questionnaire. The data collected by the decennial census determine the number of seats each state has in the U.S. House of Representatives and is also used to distribute billions in federal funds to local communities. The questionnaire consisted of a limited number of questions but allowed for the collection of information on the number of people in the household and their relationship to the householder, an individual's age, sex, race and Hispanic ethnicity, the number of housing units and whether those units are owner- or renter-occupied, or vacant. Results for sub-state geographic areas in New Mexico were released in a series of data products. These data come from Summary File 1 (SF-1). The geographic coverage for SF-1 includes the state, counties, places (both incorporated and unincorporated communities), tribal lands, school districts, census tracts, block groups and blocks, among others. The data in this particular RGIS Clearinghouse table is for Union County and all census blocks in the county. Table DC10_01130 shows counts of housing units by vacancy status (type of vacancy). The table includes the number of vacant housing units by the following categories; total, for rent, rented but not yet occupied, for sale only, sold but not yet occupied, seasonal or recreational or occasional use, for migrant workers, and vacant for some other reason. This file, along with file-specific descriptions (in Word and text formats) are available in a single zip file." ;
