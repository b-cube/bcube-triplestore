    dc:description "TIGER, TIGER/Line, and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the Bureauof the Census. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files are an extractof selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGERdata base. The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a countyor statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on January 1,2000 legal boundaries. A complete set of Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Linefiles includes all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the UnitedStates and Puerto Rico. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files willnot include files for the Island Areas. The Census TIGER data base representsa seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, eachcounty-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent dataset or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation. The RedistrictingCensus 2000 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physicalfeatures and governmental and statistical boundaries. The Redistricting Census2000 TIGER/Line files do NOT contain the ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) and the address ranges are of approximately the same vintage as those appearing in the 1999 TIGER/Line files. That is, the Census Bureau is producing theRedistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files in advance of the computer processing that will ensure that the address ranges in the TIGER/Line files agree with the final Master Address File (MAF) used for tabulating Census 2000. The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There are 17 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features, and area boundaries. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line data dictionary contains a complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types." ;
