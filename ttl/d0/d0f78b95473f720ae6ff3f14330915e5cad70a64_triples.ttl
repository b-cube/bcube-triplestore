    dc:description "The distribution and abundance of Colorado River cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii pleuriticus; CRCT) have declined from historical levels over their entire range. For this CRCT assessment we used existing information provided by 48 fisheries professionals applied through a consistent methodology to assess the extent of CRCT historical range, their current distribution, including genetic status, and evaluated the foreseeable risks to 285 populations designated as \"conservation populations\" by management agencies. We estimated CRCT historically occupied about 21,386 miles of habitat in the western U.S. CRCT currently occupy about 3,022 miles of habitat in 51 of the 61 4th level HUCs historically occupied. Of the 3,022 currently occupied miles, 224 occur outside of our estimate of historical habitat. Thirteen percent of the historically occupied habitat is currently occupied. The 224 miles of occupied habitat outside estimated historical habitat would equal an addition 1% of the total historically occupied habitat. These streams are typically above historical barriers in stream segments not believed to have been historically occupied but still within the historical range. Genetic testing has been completed across about 1,150 miles of habitat (38% of occupied habitats), but sample sizes were variable. CRCT with no evidence of genetic introgression currently occupy about 782 stream miles (26%) of occupied habitat. Another 68 miles of currently occupied habitats (2%) contained CRCT identified as part of a mixed stock where the CRCT were not introgressed even though hybridizing trout were present. We propose that even though genetic sampling was nonrandom because sampling likely occurred more frequently in CRCT populations which appeared non-introgressed, some of the habitats currently occupied by CRCT with no genetic testing likely support populations which are not introgressed. An additional 470 miles of occupied habitat were identified as containing genetically unaltered CRCT based on no record of stocking or by having no hybridizing species present. Most of the habitats currently occupied by CRCT (74% of currently occupied habitat) were on lands administrated by Federal agencies. Two-thirds of all occupied habitats occur on National Forests. An additional 23 miles were in designated National Parks and 209 miles were within Bureau of Land Management managed lands. Approximately 466 miles of occupied habitat on National Forest Lands were within designated wilderness. A total of 285 separate CRCT populations currently occupying 1,796 miles of habitat were designated as \"conservation populations\" (59% of currently occupied habitat, 8% of historical). These conservation populations were spread throughout the historical range, occurring in 34 of the 51 hydrologic units historically occupied by CRCT. Two-thirds of these conservation populations were isolated from other populations, isolated populations occurred in 739 miles or 41% of occupied habitat; well-connected meta-populations occupied 280 miles or 16% of occupied habitat. Of the 285 designated conservation populations, 153 (54%) tested as genetically unaltered or were viewed as being potentially unaltered. More isolated populations were at higher risks due to temporal variability, population size, and isolation than metapopulations, but these isolated populations were generally at less risk from hybridization and disease than meta-populations. The protocol used for this assessment was not designed to address lake populations. As of 2003, the CRCT Conservation Team was tracking 41 lakes containing conservation populations. When one of these lakes was connected to occupied stream habitat, its length was included in the current assessment. Eighteen of the 41 lakes are included as seven stream miles in this assessment. Other lakes with conservation populations were either not connected to a stream system or not connected to a known stream population of CRCT but are still believed to have important conservation value. There are additional lakes included in both the historical, currently occupied, and conservation population habitat totals which were not being previously tracked. The CRCT Conservation Team is currently working to revise the database to include lakes as polygons. This assessment shows CRCT currently are well distributed across their historical range. The data suggest genetically unaltered CRCT occupy at least 26% and possibly up to 41% of currently occupied habitats. Two different conservation management strategies are needed and being implemented to conserve CRCT. One strategy concentrates on preventing introgression, disease and competition risks through isolation of CRCT, while the other concentrates on preserving meta-population function and multiple life-history strategies by connecting occupied habitats. Currently, most conservation populations are isolated although there are ongoing restoration efforts to create meta-populations." ;
