    dc:description "This update version differs from the original release in four ways; First, the data format for the original release was an ArcInfo coverage, while the update release is an ArcInfo GRID. Second, the original's projection was Geographic with NAD83 datum. The update's projection is Albers Conic Equal Area with NAD83 datum. Third, the coding scheme for land cover classes was changed to match the coding scheme used in the Kansas Land Cover Patterns 2005 database. Fourth, an additional generalization procedure that was utilized for the 2005 KLCP database was applied to the 1990 KLCP database (see addendum to Process Description). This update facilitates comparing the 1990 KLCP dataset to the 2005 KLCP dataset on a more equal basis. Process Description: Process Description: Sixteen Landsat Thematic Mapper scenes were required to completely cover the state of Kansas. Several factors were taken into consideration for data selection. Timeliness of the data was a primary concern, limiting the data to scenes acquired within 1-2 years of the project start date (1/90). For optimal distinction of agricultural land use and forest cover, the data were acquired for the growing season, between June 1 and September 30. Scenes were required to be completely cloud-free, except in the small areas of overlap between scenes. As a result of these constraints, data from 1988, 1989, and 1990 were used. Whenever possible, all scenes for a particular path were ordered with the same acquisition date. Data tapes were inspected for cloud cover, line dropout, and scene noise. Data from each full TM scene were downloaded to disk and areas slightly larger than the individual counties were then subset. In cases where county boundaries extended across two scenes within a row (e.g., Path 29, Rows 33 and 34), common control points and a cubic convolution resampling algorithm were used to combine scene fragments to create a complete county. If radiometric differences between scenes from adjacent rows were relatively small, a histogram matching process (ERDAS programs HSTMATCH and STRETCH) was used to adjust the brightness values for one scene to match the other. Typically, the smaller of the two fragments was matched to the larger fragment. In several cases, data for a county were composed of scene fragments from adjacent paths (e.g., Paths 29 and 30) and the radiometric characteristics of the two scenes differed radically due to differences in acquisition date or data processing. Data for these special counties were processed separately and then joined after analysis was nearly complete. Data were not geometrically rectified before processing, maintaining original radiometric values whenever possible. It was found during the prototype phase that rectification before classification \"smeared\" the spectral values for stock ponds such that they were no longer classified as water. This was unacceptable because, although they are small, stock ponds represent an important, and sometimes substantial, water resource in many Kansas counties. The data were processed county by county for two reasons. First, this approach served to stratify the data into areas small enough that a degree of homogeneity within the spectral classes could be maintained. Second, counties were natural units with which to tile the data and also release to users. Initial processing of the digital data consisted of clustering and classification of rural and urban classes and the manual digitization and overlay of specified additional cover types. Six of the TM bands (all except band 6, thermal) were used for clustering. An unsupervised classification technique was used, with the data being initially clustered into a large number of spectral classes and then consolidated by an analyst into the five rural and five urban information classes. Certain features easily visible on the imagery but not easily classified using spectral classifiers were manually digitized and then merged with the classified raster data. For the five rural classes, an ISODATA clustering algorithm was used to create 100 spectral clusters that were then classed using a minimum-distance classifier. The number of clusters was set at 100 based on previous broad-area land cover mapping experience at KARS. For a few counties, different numbers of clusters were tried, but with limited success. A smaller number of clusters (for example, 75) resulted in more confusion classes, while a larger number of clusters (e.g., 125 or 150) failed to resolve the most difficult confusion classes. Tests between the maximum-likelihood and the minimum-distance classifiers during the pilot phase revealed no significant difference in classification accuracy or class area. The minimum-distance classifier, therefore, was chosen because of its speed and relative reliability. After the initial rural classification was completed, the analyst assigned the 100 spectral classes to the five rural information classes: cropland, grassland, woodland, water, and other. This was accomplished using an iterative two-step process. In the first step, the analyst displayed an area of the county for which NHAP2 air photo coverage was available. Normally, the image was displayed in bands 4, 5, and 7 (RGB), which gave best visual separability of the major information classes. The ERDAS CLASOVR function was used to overlay the 100-class raster file over the image, using either the blue or red color gun, depending on analyst preference. Spectral classes were then highlighted one at a time while the analyst made notes of the tentative assignment of the classes to information classes, referring when necessary to the NHAP2 reference photo. The analyst's notes included a judgment of whether classes were relatively \"pure\" or confused. Following this, the analyst then displayed the 100-class raster file alone and used the ERDAS COLORMOD function to assign information class colors to the individual classes. The analyst first colored up the relatively pure classes, then went back and made a best fit of the remaining, confused, classes using the context of the pure classes as a visual guide. Once this was complete and the analyst was satisfied with the class assignments, the RECODE function was used to create a five-class raster map of rural classes. A similar process, with minor modifications, was used to derive the five urban classes: residential, commercial/industrial, open land, woodland, and water. Whereas in the rural classification, an entire county image area was used for creating the ISODATA clusters, for the urban classification an image subset consisting primarily of urban cover types was used for creating the ISODATA clusters. Fifty clusters were created for the urban classes, a number that was arrived at by trial and error. As with rural classification, a minimum-distance classifier was used to create a 50-class raster file, after which the two-step CLASOVER and COLORMOD process was used to assign spectral classes to urban information classes. Again, RECODE was used to create a five-class raster map of urban land cover. Certain landscape features were easily visible in the imagery but were not easily classified using a spectral classifier. In many cases, a feature such as a highway would be classified with partial success, but would not be recognizable after cartographic generalization. In other cases, certain classes of features would consistently be misclassified (for example, sandbars in rivers and streams were frequently confused with the bare soil of plowed cropland). It was decided that some of these classes of features were desirable in the final land cover map, including four-lane highways, major dams, sandbars, and large quarries and gravel pits. These were screen digitized from images displayed on the computer screen and then gridded into raster GIS files for later merging with the rural and urban raster GIS maps. Since separate urban and rural classifications were performed, it was necessary to create urban masks in order to be able to merge the urban classes into the rural base map. This was accomplished by screen digitizing the urban outlines directly from the imagery displayed on the screen. During this process, reference was made to aerial photography of urban areas in Kansas available in the KARS library. These photos included Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) crop monitoring slides, State of Kansas Reappraisal photography, Forest Service photography, and color infrared National High Altitude Photography (NHAP2). As with almost any automated classification technique, the initial raw land cover maps were characterized by \"speckling\" produced by misclassification of single pixels or small groups of pixels. To eliminate much of the visual noise caused by these misclassified pixels, the raw maps were generalized using a series of both automated and manual procedures. To remove single isolated pixels Remove1, a program written at KARS, was employed. Remove1 removes single isolated pixels for specified classes, for example, crop, grass, and woodland. The water classes, on the other hand, were not included in Remove1 because single water pixels often represented actual water bodies, such as small stock ponds. Following a first run of Remove1, a second program, Smoother, was used to remove short rows or columns of pixels jutting out anomalously from large homogeneous areas. Finally, Remove1 was run a second time to remove any isolated pixels created by running Smoother. This initial generalization procedure not only had the effect of removing noise but also of greatly reducing the number of polygons in the map. This reduction of polygons was important in the raster-to-vector conversion process, because the number of polygons in a county map frequently approached or exceeded the then Arc/Info limit of 10,000 polygons in a coverage. After raster generalization, the county maps were converted from ERDAS raster format to Arc/Info coverages and further generalized. The Arc/Info ELIMINATE function was run in order to remove polygons not meeting the minimum mapping unit requirements of the project. Thresholds for polygon elimination varied according to land cover type: 1 acre for urban woodland and woodland (classes 4 and 8), 3 acres for Urban Residential, Urban Commercial/Industrial, Urban Openland, and Other (classes 1, 2, 3, and 10), and 5 acres for Cropland and Grassland (classes 6 and 7). The Urban Water and Water classes (classes 5 and 9) were not subjected to elimination, the rationale being that in the majority of cases small water polygons represented actual water bodies, as described above, rather than misclassified pixels. As the project progressed generally from east to west across Kansas, several problems with the automated classification procedures arose that made it necessary to make modifications in the methodology. The first group of problems involved misclassifications of crop and grassland. With regard to grassland, areas of exposed soil on sparse or over-grazed rangeland often were misclassified as cropland, being confused with the bare soil of plowed fields. A second problem with grassland was that lush riparian areas of mixed grasses and shrubs were often confused with cropland due to their high infrared reflectance. With cropland, some areas of fallow fields were confused with grassland, possibly because of weedy areas that had grown up in them. Because these areas of confusion were often quite extensive and did not lend themselves to refinement with automated classification methods, it became necessary to employ visual techniques to refine them. First, the raster generalization procedure was modified. The purpose was to remove larger clumps of misclassified pixels from crop and grassland before converting to vector format. To accomplish this, the ERDAS CLUMP and SIEVE procedures were used to generalize the two major Kansas land cover classes: cropland and grassland (classes 6 and 7). The clump size thresholds selected for these two classes varied somewhat according to the overall land cover patterns of the county in question. In general, in the eastern part of the state, where parcel sizes tend to be smaller and more interspersed, clump sizes of approximately 10 pixels were used, while in the west, where parcel sizes are larger and land cover is more homogeneous, clump sizes of up to 20 pixels were used. With much of the noise eliminated, it was easier to use visual techniques to remove remaining clusters of misclassified pixels. Our procedure was to display the raster image for the county, usually in bands 4, 5, and 7 (RGB) for best visual discrimination, and then overlay the classified raster GIS map on the computer monitor using the ERDAS GISOVR command. By toggling the display plane for the GIS map on and off, it was possible to quickly see most of the areas of gross misclassification. Then, with the image and GIS map still displayed, the ERDAS DIGSCRN function was used to outline areas of pixels to be eliminated. For difficult areas, the analyst referred to photographs or color slides of the area in question on a small light table next to the workstation. The screen digitized areas were gridded into the GIS map periodically using the ERDAS GRDPOL command. This procedure was repeated until a satisfactory map was created. Water and woodland classification also became problematic in western Kansas. Whereas in the eastern part of the state it had been possible to break out these classes with reliable regularity via the unsupervised classification, in western Kansas it became difficult to separate water bodies from saturated soils (one image in southwest Kansas had been acquired soon after heavy rains had fallen, creating numerous temporary ponds and pockets of saturated soils) and woods from shrub/grass areas along streams and rivers. Our solution was to separately classify woods and water using a supervised technique and then merge them into the classified raster GIS map. Image to map rectification was performed on the vector version of the classified data on a county by county basis. Image column-row positions were transformed to state plane feet coordinates using the Arc/Info TRANSFORM command. Initially, 15 to 20 ground control points (GCPs) were established for rectification of each county depending on county size. GCPs were chosen based on two criteria: they were easily identified on the imagery and they were evenly distributed across the county. Most often the points chosen were at section corners, especially in rural counties. Major road intersections often served as GCPs in urbanized areas. GCPs were interactively selected from the imagery to sub-pixel accuracy. The corresponding map GCPs were digitized from 1:24,000 scale USGS 7.5' topographic quadrangles. The root mean square (RMS) error for digitizer setup of the map from which the GCPs were taken was .003\" (at scale, + or - 6 feet). Trial calculations of the affine transformation (scale, rotation and translation) were performed. They were assessed for how well the derived transformation performed vis-a-vis the reported RMS error for the transform. Transformations were allowed a total RMS error of 1/3 pixel (approximately 33 feet). Individual pixel RMS errors were allowed up to 1/2 pixel (approximately 49 feet). GCPs exceeding the allowable individual error or contributing too much to the overall error were eliminated. In general, between 10 and 15 GCPs were left for performing the transformation. In no case were fewer than 10 GCPs used for a county transformation. Because the counties were classified individually, edge matching problems between adjacent counties arose. Two strategies were employed for edge matching between counties. The first strategy was used with counties that were subset from the same image scene and took place while the data were still in raster form. The procedure simply \"borrowed\" a narrow strip, 9 pixels wide, from an adjacent, previously completed county. Input pixels from the previously competed county were allowed to overwrite pixels in the current county. The second strategy was applied to counties that were subset from two (or more) image scenes and took place after the data were converted to vector coverages and were transformed. The concept is similar to the first strategy in that a narrow strip, also 9 pixels wide was \"borrowed\" from an adjacent, previously completed county. In this process, a strip of the previously completed county was spliced onto the current county using the Arc/Info UPDATE command. Minor editing of arcs and polygons was necessary after the update to improve the cartographic appearance of the splice. For example, slight differences in orientation between the two transformed classified maps resulted in arcs with \"jags\" along the edge of the splice. In addition, small polygons were sometimes created during the update. These were deleted. Because Kansas is split into two state plane zones, North and South, some counties required temporary projection of the coverage to the Universal Transverse Mercator projection for the edge matching procedure. After edge matching, the coverages were projected back to their appropriate state plane zone. Contract specifications required that coverages to be delivered in decimal geographic coordinates. In order to maintain spatial precision for the projected coordinates, the geographic coverage was represented with double precision real numbers. The geographic coverage was then clipped with the appropriate double precision county boundary. The source data for the county boundary coverage were digitized by the Kansas Geological Survey from 7.5' USGS topographic quadrangles as part of their Kansas Cartographic Database (KCD). The KCD is part of the Data Access and Support Center's Core Database. It was discovered that the clipping process sometimes shifted the intersection location of arcs lying along the county boundary by a very small amount (1 x 10-14 degree). This necessitated a final edge matching between counties. The procedure simply snapped intersections occurring along the county boundary to a previously completed coverage. Addendum: Additional Processing Steps Performed for the 2008 Update of the 1990 Kansas Land Cover Patterns Dataset. The original 1990 KLCP vector coverage was reprojected from Georgraphic to Albers Conic Equal Area. The reprojected coverage was then converted to a raster grid with a cell size of 30-meters. The grid was then recoded to match the coding scheme of the 2005 KLCP (which also more closely conforms to the USGS Anderson Level II coding scheme). Here is the recode table used: Class 1990 KLCP code 2005 KLCP Code Commercial/Industrial 2 11 Residential 1 12 Urban Openland 3 13 Urban Woodland 4 14 Urban Water 5 15 Cropland 6 20 Grassland 7 30 CRP Land NA 31 Woodland 8 40 Water 9 50 Other 10 60 USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) Common Land Unit (CLU) field boundary data were then used to fit the Cropland and Grassland classes into fields delineated in the CLU data. The objective was to utilize the spatial precision of field boundaries provided by the CLU data to better depict the spatial extent of Cropland and Grassland. To conduct the generalization, individual unattributed CLU field-boundary shapefiles, roughly corresponding to a county, were merged into one file covering the state and then converted to a raster grid. Output raster cells were assigned the feature identifier (FID) of the shapefile during the conversion to a grid because the value was unique and thus could be used to identify unique zones. The following outlines the procedures for this generalization step. 1. Create a Cropland/Grassland grid by recoding all values other than Cropland (20) and Grassland (30) on the original grid to NODATA. 2. For each Zone in the CLU grid, calculate the ZONALMAJORITY for the Cropland/Grassland grid. 3. Using the original grid, write all values other than Cropland and Grassland to a new output grid, recoding Cropland and Grassland areas to Zero (0) 4. Write the ZonalMajority values from Step 2 to the new grid, filling only Zero areas." ;

A similar process, with minor modifications, was used to derive the five urban classes: residential, commercial/industrial, open land, woodland, and water. Whereas in the rural classification, an entire county image area was used for creating the ISODATA clusters, for the urban classification an image subset consisting primarily of urban cover types was used for creating the ISODATA clusters. Fifty clusters were created for the urban classes, a number that was arrived at by trial and error.

During this process, reference was made to aerial photography of urban areas in Kansas available in the KARS library.

As with almost any automated classification technique, the initial raw land cover maps were characterized by \"speckling\" produced by misclassification of single pixels or small groups of pixels. To eliminate much of the visual noise caused by these misclassified pixels, the raw maps were generalized using a series of both automated and manual procedures.

Following a first run of Remove1, a second program, Smoother, was used to remove short rows or columns of pixels jutting out anomalously from large homogeneous areas. Finally, Remove1 was run a second time to remove any isolated pixels created by running Smoother. This initial generalization procedure not only had the effect of removing noise but also of greatly reducing the number of polygons in the map. This reduction of polygons was important in the raster-to-vector conversion process, because the number of polygons in a county map frequently approached or exceeded the then Arc/Info limit of 10,000 polygons in a coverage. After raster generalization, the county maps were converted from ERDAS raster format to Arc/Info coverages and further generalized. The Arc/Info ELIMINATE function was run in order to remove polygons not meeting the minimum mapping unit requirements of the project. Thresholds for polygon elimination varied according to land cover type: 1 acre for urban woodland and woodland (classes 4 and 8), 3 acres for Urban Residential, Urban Commercial/Industrial, Urban Openland, and Other (classes 1, 2, 3, and 10), and 5 acres for Cropland and Grassland (classes 6 and 7). The Urban Water and Water classes (classes 5 and 9) were not subjected to elimination, the rationale being that in the majority of cases small water polygons represented actual water bodies, as described above, rather than misclassified pixels. As the project progressed generally from east to west across Kansas, several problems with the automated classification procedures arose that made it necessary to make modifications in the methodology.

In general, in the eastern part of the state, where parcel sizes tend to be smaller and more interspersed, clump sizes of approximately 10 pixels were used, while in the west, where parcel sizes are larger and land cover is more homogeneous, clump sizes of up to 20 pixels were used. With much of the noise eliminated, it was easier to use visual techniques to remove remaining clusters of misclassified pixels. Our procedure was to display the raster image for the county, usually in bands 4, 5, and 7 (RGB) for best visual discrimination, and then overlay the classified raster GIS map on the computer monitor using the ERDAS GISOVR command.

The screen digitized areas were gridded into the GIS map periodically using the ERDAS GRDPOL command. This procedure was repeated until a satisfactory map was created. Water and woodland classification also became problematic in western Kansas. Whereas in the eastern part of the state it had been possible to break out these classes with reliable regularity via the unsupervised classification, in western Kansas it became difficult to separate water bodies from saturated soils (one image in southwest Kansas had been acquired soon after heavy rains had fallen, creating numerous temporary ponds and pockets of saturated soils) and woods from shrub/grass areas along streams and rivers. Our solution was to separately classify woods and water using a supervised technique and then merge them into the classified raster GIS map. Image to map rectification was performed on the vector version of the classified data on a county by county basis. Image column-row positions were transformed to state plane feet coordinates using the Arc/Info TRANSFORM command. Initially, 15 to 20 ground control points (GCPs) were established for rectification of each county depending on county size. GCPs were chosen based on two criteria: they were easily identified on the imagery and they were evenly distributed across the county. Most often the points chosen were at section corners, especially in rural counties. Major road intersections often served as GCPs in urbanized areas. GCPs were interactively selected from the imagery to sub-pixel accuracy. The corresponding map GCPs were digitized from 1:24,000 scale USGS 7.5' topographic quadrangles. The root mean square (RMS) error for digitizer setup of the map from which the GCPs were taken was .003\" (at scale, + or - 6 feet). Trial calculations of the affine transformation (scale, rotation and translation) were performed. They were assessed for how well the derived transformation performed vis-a-vis the reported RMS error for the transform. Transformations were allowed a total RMS error of 1/3 pixel (approximately 33 feet). Individual pixel RMS errors were allowed up to 1/2 pixel (approximately 49 feet). GCPs exceeding the allowable individual error or contributing too much to the overall error were eliminated. In general, between 10 and 15 GCPs were left for performing the transformation. In no case were fewer than 10 GCPs used for a county transformation. Because the counties were classified individually, edge matching problems between adjacent counties arose. Two strategies were employed for edge matching between counties. The first strategy was used with counties that were subset from the same image scene and took place while the data were still in raster form. The procedure simply \"borrowed\" a narrow strip, 9 pixels wide, from an adjacent, previously completed county. Input pixels from the previously competed county were allowed to overwrite pixels in the current county. The second strategy was applied to counties that were subset from two (or more) image scenes and took place after the data were converted to vector coverages and were transformed. The concept is similar to the first strategy in that a narrow strip, also 9 pixels wide was \"borrowed\" from an adjacent, previously completed county. In this process, a strip of the previously completed county was spliced onto the current county using the Arc/Info UPDATE command. Minor editing of arcs and polygons was necessary after the update to improve the cartographic appearance of the splice. For example, slight differences in orientation between the two transformed classified maps resulted in arcs with \"jags\" along the edge of the splice. In addition, small polygons were sometimes created during the update. These were deleted. Because Kansas is split into two state plane zones, North and South, some counties required temporary projection of the coverage to the Universal Transverse Mercator projection for the edge matching procedure. After edge matching, the coverages were projected back to their appropriate state plane zone. Contract specifications required that coverages to be delivered in decimal geographic coordinates. In order to maintain spatial precision for the projected coordinates, the geographic coverage was represented with double precision real numbers. The geographic coverage was then clipped with the appropriate double precision county boundary. The source data for the county boundary coverage were digitized by the Kansas Geological Survey from 7.5' USGS topographic quadrangles as part of their Kansas Cartographic Database (KCD). The KCD is part of the Data Access and Support Center's Core Database. It was discovered that the clipping process sometimes shifted the intersection location of arcs lying along the county boundary by a very small amount (1 x 10-14 degree). This necessitated a final edge matching between counties. The procedure simply snapped intersections occurring along the county boundary to a previously completed coverage. Addendum: Additional Processing Steps Performed for the 2008 Update of the 1990 Kansas Land Cover Patterns Dataset. The original 1990 KLCP vector coverage was reprojected from Georgraphic to Albers Conic Equal Area. The reprojected coverage was then converted to a raster grid with a cell size of 30-meters. The grid was then recoded to match the coding scheme of the 2005 KLCP (which also more closely conforms to the USGS Anderson Level II coding scheme). Here is the recode table used: Class 1990 KLCP code 2005 KLCP Code Commercial/Industrial 2 11 Residential 1 12 Urban Openland 3 13 Urban Woodland 4 14 Urban Water 5 15 Cropland 6 20 Grassland 7 30 CRP Land NA 31 Woodland 8 40 Water 9 50 Other 10 60 USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) Common Land Unit (CLU) field boundary data were then used to fit the Cropland and Grassland classes into fields delineated in the CLU data. The objective was to utilize the spatial precision of field boundaries provided by the CLU data to better depict the spatial extent of Cropland and Grassland. To conduct the generalization, individual unattributed CLU field-boundary shapefiles, roughly corresponding to a county, were merged into one file covering the state and then converted to a raster grid. Output raster cells were assigned the feature identifier (FID) of the shapefile during the conversion to a grid because the value was unique and thus could be used to identify unique zones. The following outlines the procedures for this generalization step. 1. Create a Cropland/Grassland grid by recoding all values other than Cropland (20) and Grassland (30) on the original grid to NODATA. 2. For each Zone in the CLU grid, calculate the ZONALMAJORITY for the Cropland/Grassland grid. 3. Using the original grid, write all values other than Cropland and Grassland to a new output grid, recoding Cropland and Grassland areas to Zero (0) 4. Write the ZonalMajority values from Step 2 to the new grid, filling only Zero areas.
