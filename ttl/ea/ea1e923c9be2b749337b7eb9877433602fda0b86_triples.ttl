    dc:description "The CREEK Project began in January of 1996 and was designed to help determine the role of oysters, Crassostrea virginica, in tidal creeks of the North Inlet Estuary, South Carolina, USA. A group of eight intertidal creeks with high densities of oysters were studied using a replicated BACI (Before - After Control - Incident) design in which all creeks are sampled simultaneously. By the fall of 1996, based on preliminary geomorphological observations of North Inlet creeks, eight creeks similar in size and configuration were selected and a survey was conducted to estimate the oyster biomass in each creek. In January of 1997, oysters were added or removed from each creek to equalize oyster biomass at 8 grams dry body weight per cubic meter of bank full water volume. This marked the beginning of the \"pre-manipulation year\" and the collection of baseline data. Nutrients and chlorophyll a were measured weekly in each creek and exhibited seasonal and inter-annual influences. Phytoplankton pigment levels were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Intensive planktonic - microbial loop and nekton abundance and biomass samplings were conducted seasonally. Oyster growth and survival were measured monthly and information was gathered on the dispersal of the oyster parasite Perkinsus marinus. A habitat survey was also conducted in January of 1998 to categorize the creek bottom types for the database. In February of 1998, oysters were removed from 4 of the 8 creeks (creeks 1, 4, 5, and 8) and collection of the same data for the \"manipulation year\" began. In May of 2000, a final biomass estimate was performed to determine if oyster recruitment and trampling during sampling activities had altered oyster biomass during the manipulation phase of the study. In the tidal creeks of North Inlet Estuary, the Eastern oyster C. virginica is an abundant component of the benthic macrofauna and exerts controls on microbial communities through its grazing and nutrient regenerative activities. This subcomponent of the CREEK Project (overview above) focused on the effect that oysters have on another important element of the tidal creek system, the phytoplankton community. Investigators used HPLC to analyze the pigments present in selected weekly water samples gathered from control and experimental creek sites, before and after manipulation, for water chemistry analyses. Pigment levels can then be extrapolated to provide information on the types and abundance of phytoplankton in these creeks over the course of seasons and years, and in the presence and absence of oysters." ;
