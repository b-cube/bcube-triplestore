    dc:description "This geodatabase feature class contains existing vegetation within portions of Butte, Yuba, Sutter, Placer and Sacramento Counties within the Great Valley ecological region (Miles and Goudey 1997) not previously mapped as urban or agriculture by the Department of Water Resources or included in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Legal Delta or Northern Sierra Nevada Foothills vegetation maps. Agriculture and urban polygons were mapped de novo for this project and are attributed to Anderson Level 1. Between November 2011 to June 2013, polygons were hand-digitized at a scale of 1:2,000, with a minimum mapping unit (mmu) of 1 acre, and a minimum average width of 10-meters per polygon, using United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Agricultural Inventory Program (NAIP) 2009 aerial imagery as the map base. The map classification follows the National Vegetation Classification System and the State of California standards as found in the Manual of California Vegetation (Sawyer et al 2009) and was developed in conjunction with the Vegetation Classification and Mapping Program (VegCAMP) of the Department of Fish and Wildlife. Polygons are mapped to Alliance level when possible, or to Group level or Mapping Unit when not. The classification includes several provisional groups and alliances which are not currently found in the Manual of California Vegetation. Please see detailed report of mapping standards (GIC 2013) for more information. An Accuracy Assessment of the map was conducted by VegCAMP. Despite every attempt to sample adequate numbers of all mapped types, 30 map units had a sample size of n<5, resulting in approximately 57% of all map types with reportable results. For the assessed map units, the overall users? accuracy averaged 90.2% and producers? accuracy averaged 88.8%. Since the preferred accuracy for fine-scale vegetation mapping products is 80%, the map exceeded the standard overall, and did not meet the standard in only two classes, the Baccharis pilularis Alliance (78%) and Robinia pseudoacacia Semi-natural Stands (71%). See the detailed report on the accuracy assessment for methods and results including a contingency table of users? and producers? accuracy scores (VegCAMP 2013).
