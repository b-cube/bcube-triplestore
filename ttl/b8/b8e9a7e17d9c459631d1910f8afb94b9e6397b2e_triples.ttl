    dc:description "Law Enforcement Locations in Arkansas Any location where sworn officers of a law enforcement agency are regularly based or stationed. Law Enforcement agencies \"are publicly funded and employ at least one full-time or part-time sworn officer with general arrest powers\". This is the definition used by the US Department of Justice - Bureau of Justice Statistics (DOJ-BJS) for their Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) survey. Although LEMAS only includes non Federal Agencies, this dataset includes locations for Federal, state, local, and special jurisdiction law enforcement agencies. Law Enforcement agencies include, but are not limited to, municipal police, county sheriffs, state police, school police, park police, railroad police, federal law enforcement agencies, departments within non law enforcement federal agencies charged with law enforcement (e.g. US Postal Inspectors), and cross jurisdictional authorities (e.g. Port Authority Police). Although TGS' intention is to only include locations associated with agencies that meet the above definition, TGS has discovered a few locations that are associated with agencies that are not publicly funded. TGS is deleting these locations as we become aware of them, but some probably still exist in this dataset. Generally the requirements and training for becoming a sworn law enforcement officer are set by each state. Law Enforcement agencies themselves are not chartered or licensed by their state. County, city and other government authorities within each state are generally empowered by their state law to setup or disband Law Enforcement agencies. Never the less, the agencies have visibility to state level authorities because generally sworn Law Enforcement officers must report to the state the agency they are employed by. TGS did not verify any state attributes, only the name, physical street address, city, state, five digit zip code, phone number and location were verified through phone contact. At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. At the request of NGA, all diacritics (e.g. the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] attribute. Based upon this attribute the oldest record dates from 09/13/2006 and the newest record dates from 10/24/2006." ;
