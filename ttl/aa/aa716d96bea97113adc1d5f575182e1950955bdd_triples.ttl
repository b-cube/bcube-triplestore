    dc:description "The Oscar Dyson departed Kodiak at 1300 hours on Sunday May 15th. On the way out of the bay training operations for a medical evacuation were conducted with a U.S. Coast Guard Helicopter. Following the Coast Guard ops we steamed a short distance to recover and re-deploy the Chiniak Bay subsurface mooring. A CTD cast was completed prior to recovery. The sailing plan included running through Whale Pass but due to a late departure we missed the tide at the pass and waited approximately 5 hours for the next tide. May 17 we completed a CTD cast at Pavlof Bay, recovered and re-deployed 1 mooring in the Bay. From here we sailed west and north through Unimak Pass to mooring site BS-2, arriving on May 18th. Two CTD casts were completed prior to the recovery of the two 2010 subsurface moorings. A surface mooring and two subsurface moorings were deployed at the BS-2 followed by two post deployment CTD casts. Heading north along the 70 meter line our next stop was mooring Site BS-4. On May 19 A pre-recovery CTD cast was completed prior to recovering two 2010 subsurface moorings. Due to funding restrictions the moorings at site BS-4 will not be re-deployed until the fall of 2011. We motored north to mooring site BS-5, arriving May 20th. A pre-recovery CTD cast was completed, two 2010 subsurface moorings were recovered and two 2011 sub surface moorings were deployed at this location. A post deployment CTD was completed prior to steaming north along the 70 meter isobaths. About 10 miles north of mooring site 5 we ran into a considerable amount of sea ice. It was time consuming but we jogged and picked our way through the bands of ice to station 70M44, a location 5 stations north of mooring site 5 on the 70 meter isobaths line. On 21 May we started working our way south along the 70 meter line doing a CTD cast at each station and a bongo tow at every other station. As we worked our way south at each mooring site we completed a box of stations around the mooring and a center station near the mooring. Each mooring box sampling site consisted of a CTD cast, a bongo tow and 3 Cal-Vet tows at the center station only. Following the box sampling at each mooring site we continued south along the 70 meter isobaths. In general, the weather was good as we worked our way north stopping at each mooring site. On the trip south along the 70 line we hit a little weather slowing our transit speed to 5-6 knots and causing us to tack to the station instead of traveling a direct route to minimize bucking and rolling on the ship. Itb??s difficult to plan for these situations except to factor in a weather day or two when you set up the original cruise schedule. Working our way south, when we arrived at mooring site BS-4 we broke off from CTD/Bongo operations to search for a mooring that was undoubtedly towed off by the Pollock fishing fleet late 2010. We spent approximately 24 hours running a parallel transit pattern with 2 mile spacing pinging about every mile in search of the lost mooring. No evidence of the mooring was found and I am reasonably confident that the mooring is not located within the limits of this search pattern. The batteries in the release should function long enough for us to add to our search pattern when we are back in the area Sept. 2011. Repeating our last CTD station we continued working south along the 70 meter isobaths completing CTD casts and bongo tows until we reached the end of the line just south of mooring site BS-2. From here we sailed south-east to the last of the Krab moorings. On 26 May a pre recovery CTD was completed at the Krab mooring site and that mooring was recovered. Again, due to funding limitations this mooring will not be re-deployed at this time. We steamed west for the better part of a day arriving at the first of 4 CTD stations along the east side of Unimak Pass May 27th. For the 5 stations across Unimak pass we completed a CTD cast and a bongo tow. We finished the Unimak Pass work with an optics package drop before breaking off operations and heading to Dutch Harbor. We were tied up in Captains Bay Dutch Harbor by 9am on May 28th.
