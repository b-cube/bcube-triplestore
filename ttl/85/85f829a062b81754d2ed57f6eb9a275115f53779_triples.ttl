    dc:description "The LiDAR for the North East Project, funded in large part by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, as well as, other funding sources was designed to help stimulate the U.S. economy and provide for more accurate floodplain mapping in the North East representing the start of a regional LiDAR collection program that served as a test case for a national elevation program. Lead by the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) National Geospatial Program Office and the State of Maine's Office of GIS with active collaboration and participation by other federal, state and local agencies resulted in LiDAR acquisition and processing of over 8,000 sq. miles of (LiDAR) data of a coastal zone spanning six North Eastern states, including Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New York. USGS's National Geospatial Technical Operations Center (USGS NGTOC) in Rolla, MO provided project management and quality control oversight for the project which consisted of two Task Orders issued to USGS contractor, GMR Aerial Surveys inc. d/b/a Photo Science (contractor), for task order execution through the use of USGS's Geospatial Products and Services Contract (USGS Contract: G10PC00026). Task Order specifications included state/area specific vertical accuracy, nominal post spacing and tide coordinated acquisition requirements. Specific to the State of Conneticut UTM Zone 19, LiDAR was collected in the Winter and Spring 2011 at a 2 meter or better nominal post spacing (2m GSD) for approximately 141 square miles of Conneticut UTM Zone 19, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the LiDAR data to meet task order specifications, Photo Science subcontractor, The James W. Sewall Company, established a total of 4 control points that were used to calibrate the LIDAR to known ground locations established throughout the Conneticut UTM Zone 19 project area. Additionally, Sewall established twenty (20) quality control \"blind\" check points using survey grade, dual frequency GPS receivers throughout the Conneticut UTM Zone 19 project area and the contractor supplied the coordinate and elevation data values for each point to USGS to independently validate theses required vertical accuracies. These points were not used by the Contractors production team duing any phase of the project. Conneticut UTM Zone 19 data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of UTM NAD83 (2007), UTM Zone 19, meters and vertical datum of NAVD1988 (GEOID09), meters. LiDAR data was delivered in RAW flightline swath format, processed to create Classified LAS 1.2 Files formatted to 205 individual 1500m x 1500m tiles, Hydro Flattening Breaklines in Esri shape file format, and corresponding 2.0 meter gridded Raster DEM Files tiled to the same 1500m x 1500m schema. LiDAR Data was originally delivered to USGS for quality control validation under USGS Delivery Lot 8b. The lineage (metadata), positional, content (completeness), attribution, logical consistency, and accuracies of all digital elevation data produced conform to the specifications stipulated in USGS Task Orders G10PD01027 (ARRA) and G10PD02143 (non-ARRA) and the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base LiDAR Specification, Version 12." ;
