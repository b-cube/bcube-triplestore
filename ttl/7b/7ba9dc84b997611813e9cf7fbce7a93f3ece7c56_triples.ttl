    dc:description "This dataset consists of geo-referenced digital data and associated attributes created by the DOE/ORNL NSD Resource Assessment (http://nhaap.ornl.gov/nsd).Environmental GIS data layers are categorized into eight broad groups: 1) US Fish and Wildlife Service Critical Habitats for Federally Listed Species, 2) Endangered Fish Species and Fish Species of Concern (International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) ranking system), 3) Fish Traits (e.g., potadromous fish species), 4) Protected Conservation Lands, 5) Water Quality Concerns (state 303d waterbodies), 6) Water Use, 7) Recreation and Aesthetics, and 8) Land Distrubance and The Environmental Attribution within the DOE/ORNL NSD Resource Assessment is a geospatial framework with the objective of determining potential environmental concerns related to new hydropower development. Environmental issues are defined as any ecological, socio-economic, legal/geopolitical, or landscape development concerns arising with regard to hydropower construction or operation. Environmental data used in our analysis were obtained from multiple online sources (i.e. freely-available), by purchase, or through copyright agreementsDevelopment. ORNL's NSD Resource Assessment included national, regional, and statewide assessments of potential hydropower development in heretofore undeveloped stream reaches with a nominal potential capacity greater than 1 megawatt. The assessment estimates potential installed capacity and average annual energy generation for identified stream reaches, and can also estimate inundated areas, reservoir volumes, approximate dam heights, and hydraulic heads for hypothetical development locations in those areas. The methodology was designed to accommodate the whole of over 3 million U.S. streams to identify opportunities for new hydropower development. Locations and estimated generation capacity of potential new hydropower development were identified by selecting dam locations, delineating inundated areas using digital elevation models, and identifying potential tailwater areas of impact. Thus, each potential location consisted of three elements: 1) virtual dam (point), 2) virtual inundated area (polygon), and 3) virtual tailwater (line >= 16km). Environmental variables were attributed to each potential location through geoprocessing procedures (i.e. Select-By-Location [Data Management Toolbox] and Spatial Join [Analysis Toolbox]). Each of the three elements was buffered with radii of various widths depending on the element and the environmental variable. Environmental variables intersecting each buffered element were then summarized into binary (1=presence/0=absence), count, or values (e.g. water use). The value reported for each potential location represents the maximum value for all three elements. The finest resolution of some environmental variables was the 8-digit Hydrologic Unit Scale (e.g. fish species data). Thus, buffering was not necessary.All potential locations within a 10-digit Hydrologic Unit Code watershed were jointly summarized and the values are presented below." ;
