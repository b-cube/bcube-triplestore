    dc:description "The Annual Survey of Communication is comprised of firms with payroll that provide telephone communication, radio and television broadcasting, cable television and other communication services (SIC 48). Coverage reflects 1987 SIC classifications definitions beginning in 1989. Data collected include: total revenue and revenue by source; total expenses and expenses by type. Annually since 1990; reported data are for activities taking place during the calendar year. Data collection begins about 4 months after the close of the reporting year, and continues for about 4 months. Samples are reselected every 5 years and updated annually; use of latest sample began in 1996. The method is incorporates a mail-out/mail-back survey of about 2,000 selected employer firms. The sample was constructed from communications firms listed in the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL). The SSEL contains Federal Identification Numbers (EINs) for establishments with payroll, and locations for listed businesses. EINs may represent one or more establishments and companies with payroll may have one or more EIN. Firms are first stratified by payroll and kind of business group. All companies with total revenue (estimated from payroll) above applicable size cutoffs are included in the survey and report for all their industry EINs. In a second stage, unselected EINs are stratified by kind of business group and revenue, and a simple random sample is taken from each stratum. The sample is updated for employer business \"births\" and \"deaths\" in an annual procedure. Companies and EINs that are not active in a survey year are dropped from the sample. New EINs are identified in a birth selection procedure and included in the survey. Annual Survey of Communication Services reports are released 11 months after the reporting period. Summary statistics are provided on revenue, revenue by source, and expenses by kind of business at the 4-digit SIC level." ;
