    dc:description "Ozark - St. Francis National Forests stand inventory data for vegetation, maintained in polygon format. Polygon boundaries that provide areas to be rotated for entry of timber inventory and management. Stand is defined as a spatially continuous group of trees and associated vegetation having similar structures and growing under similar soil and climatic conditions.Vegetation polygons support Forest Service vegetation data management and analysis. Vegetation data is critical in support of land management; whether it be for wildlife habitat analysis, fire and fuels management, watershed management, or timber production. A vegetation polygon is a logical sampling unit; a logical area of land on which to describe vegetation conditions. Over time, data is collected for some or all of these polygons. Data such as canopy cover or forest type may be derived for each polygon via satellite image processing or photo interpretation. Field crews may be sent to a selection of polygons to collect detailed data where individual trees are measured or down woody material is measured along transects. The amount and currency of data describing each vegetation polygon varies widely since it is cost-prohibitive to maintain detailed and current data for all polygons at any point in time. Data for some polygons may be more than 10 years old, while data for other polygons may have been collected yesterday. Typically where active project work or landscape analysis is occurring, better data is available since there is a need for good data for that area at that point in time. Data for polygons within the NRIS_VegPoly feature class is changing on a daily basis as data is updated by Forest Service staff. This feature class is a \"working\" dataset; that is, it supports day-to-day Forest Service land management." ;
