    dc:description "\"Tomales Bay is a submerged rift valley lying along the axis of the northwest-trending, seismically active San Andreas fault zone. Protected bay sediments are being deposited in a narrow, elongated, structural depression, characterized by known strike-slip faulting in historic times. The primary objective of this investigation is to determine the relative effects of normal depositional processes and contemporaneous strike-slip faulting on the Recent sediment facies, thickness, distribution, and depositional history in Tomales Bay. The stratigraphic succession and major internal structure of the Recent sediments in the southern two-thirds of the bay were determined by combining an acoustic-reflection survey (Sonoprobe) with lithologic data obtained from cores and test borings. Lithologic variations of the Tomales Bay surface sediments are attributed to 1.) the location and character of the sediment sources and 2.) the dispersal of sediment by tidal currents. Sandy sediments, supplied to the bay entrance by southerly longshore currents, have been subsequently redistributed throughout the northern third of the bay by tidal currents. Within this area of sand deposition, further textural subdivisions can be made on the basis of size-sorting relationships and size-frequency distributions. A textural transition zone marks the boundary between the sandy sediments and the fine-grained homogeneous sediments of the remaining two-thirds of the bay. Large quantities of sediment fill have been deposited in historic times and are situated near the mouths of Walker and Lagunitas Creeks, which have supplied the fine-grained sediment to the bay. The subaerial rift valley, prior to the Late Wisconsin rise in sea level, contained features of fault morphology. A prominent, discontinuous, center rift ridge was present throughout the valley. When developed this ridge divided the valley into two topographically lower segments elongated parallel to the axis of the San Andreas fault zone. During the initial post-Wisconsin transgression, a basal transgressive facies was deposited locally over the pre-transgressive surface. Sand was transported southward from Bodega Bay and a constricting sand spit was formed southeast of Hog Island. South of this spit, muds were deposited and a mudflat and channel system developed. As sea level continued to rise, the entrance to Tomales Bay was gradually filled by sand. A new bay mouth spit (Sand Point) began to form. The formation of this feature at the bay entrance decreased the sand supplied to the southern bay. The southernmost sand spit was gradually transgressed and younger muds began to fill in the former tidal channels and cover the older mudflats. Small depressions, found along the bay margins south of Pelican Point, are the relicts of former tidal channels and are not related to seismic activity. Locations of several fault traces are inferred from vertical separations of the pre-transgressive surface. Net slip of the fault displacements was not determined since clear lines of displacement were not established. Factors of basin geometry, a rising sea level, and the rates of sediment supply and dispersal, have been more important than active strike-slip faulting in determining the stratigraphy and internal structure of the Tomales Bay Recent sediments.\"" ;
