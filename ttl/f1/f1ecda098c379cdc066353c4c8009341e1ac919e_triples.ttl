    dc:description "\"The long-term beach and offshore sand movement along the portion of the northern California coast between Drakes Bay and the Russian River has been studied. Analysis of hindcast swell data, availability of sand for transport, refraction diagrams and knowledge of stable shapes of sedimentary coastlines suggested that under present conditions little net longshore movement of sand occurs in the area and that the beaches are generally in equilibrium with negligible supply or loss of sand. Surface sediment samples were collected from beaches and offshore zones. Twelve sedimentary petrologic provinces were outlined on the basis of the patterns of heavy mineral distribution. Sands of the provinces nearest the dioritic cliffs of the headlands, Point Reyes, Tomales Point and Bodega Head, have been derived from these cliffs by erosion during the present sedimentation period. The dioritic debris have been supplied from the cliffs at an imperceptibly slow, yet geologically significant, rate. The heavy mineral compositions of the headland are distinctly different from the dioritic sands near the headlands. The mineralogical evidence confirms the results of initial analysis, and shows that negligible quantities of sand move southward around the headlands. In effect the headlands Point Reyes and Bodega Head are barriers to longshore transport. West of Point Reyes Beach the grain size and heavy mineral patterns of distribution indicate that the sands beyond 90 feet are relatively inactive. These sands are probably relic deposits of an ancient period of sand transportation and deposition. The sands of several of the active nearshore provinces apparently were derived and originally made available for coastal transport during ancient sedimentation periods. These active sands now exist in a relatively stable distribution. The dilution rate as a result of present supply is negligible.\"" ;
