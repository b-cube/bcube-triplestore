    dc:description "Three consecutive tows of an epibenthic sled fitted with a 365-micron mesh net were used to collect small (1-20 mm) motile animals from just above the bottom of two estuarine tidal creek stations (designated BB and DD) every two weeks at the midday low tide in the North Inlet Estuary, SC. Since previous field studies indicated that stage of tide and time of day affected organism abundance in the epibenthic sled stations, it was necessary to make collections about every 14 days when the same tide stage occurs at the same time of day to keep these variables \"constant\". Thus, three sequential tows (known as replicates A, B, and C) were made with the same apparatus with the direction of the ebbing current along the same tow path when the end of the ebbing tide occurred near noon. Collections from 1981 through 1984 at a sandy inlet (DD) and a major marsh creek (BB) location allowed for a comparison of two habitat types. Beginning in 1985, only the BB site continued its biweekly triplicate sampling. The same gear, field deployment, and tow path have been used since sample number one, made on January 20, 1981. Physical data including air temperature, surface and bottom water temperature and salinity, dissolved oxygen, and water velocity and light penetration from the waterÂ’s surface to the bottom at 50 cm intervals were recorded just before the epibenthic collections. These parameters are listed in the EpiPhysicals81-2003 digital file. Pericarid crustaceans (i.e. mysids, amphipods), chaetognaths, hydromedusae, larval shrimps, crabs, and fishes dominated the epibenthic catches. From 1981 through 1984 all organisms were identified under a microscope to species or lowest possible taxa for both sampling sites, BB and DD; larval fish species were measured and counted, and shrimp life stages were noted and counted. Beginning in 1985 with sample 100, the taxa categories counted were merged into fewer categories in order to speed up processing. Samples with a great number of organisms were split before taxa categories were counted. Counts were adjusted by the number of times the sample was split, and then converted to numbers per cubic meter of water filtered before average numbers per sample were calculated." ;
