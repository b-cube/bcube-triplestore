    dc:description "Understanding the relationship between surface-water and ground-water systems in Western Nebraska is critical to understanding water resources and developing management programs. After eight years of sustained drought, aquifers in the Nebraska Panhandle have been strained to supply water to ground-water users and base flow to the North Platte River and Lodgepole Creek. Ground water and surface water is generally considered a single resource in the project area. Surface water irrigation projects heavily influence the Quaternary Alluvium of the North Platte River valley by providing recharge in excess of natural rates found before development. The ground water development along Lodgepole Creek has reduced stream flows through out its length. To help understand these complex relations, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) conducted an airborne resistivity and magnetic (helicopter electromagnetic, HEM) survey and follow up ground surveys in order to characterize and map the hydrogeology in sections of the North Platte River Valley and sections along Lodgepole Creek and Sidney Draw in the southern portion of the Nebraska Panhandle in Western Nebraska during the summer of 2008. The project is being conducted jointly with the USGS, the University of Nebraska (UNL) Conservation & Survey Division, and the following Natural Resource Districts: North Platte and South Platte. Approximately 1400 line km were flown with HEM in for all areas in the North Platte NRD and South Platte NRD areas with a line spacing of approximately 200 m and samples every three meters. The HEM results correlate with ground time domain electromagnetic soundings and borehole geophysical logs. The total field magnetics in each area show significant anomalies (in cases, 100's of nT) from crystalline basement features such as mafic dikes and instrusives as well as structures. These may correlate with shallower features that could control the distribution of ground water. Three-dimensional models of the resistivity and magnetic field data indicate buried hydrogeologic features and structure that may control the surface- and ground-water relationships." ;
