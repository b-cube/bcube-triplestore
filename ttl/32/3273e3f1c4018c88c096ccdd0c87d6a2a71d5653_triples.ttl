    dc:description "Samples were taken from two estuarine tidal creek stations (designated BB and DD) in the North Inlet Estuary, SC. Two large cores, with a sediment surface area of 83.3 square centimeters and a depth of 15 centimeters, were collected from each of the two sites from 1981-1985. For most of this period, cores were processed in separate 5 centimeter increments for the top, middle, and bottom portions of the core. Throughout the remainder of the study (1985-1992), eight smaller cores were collected from the BB site only in an effort to increase sampling accuracy. Although the core size and number of replicates changed, the total surface area of sediment sampled remained similar. The smaller cores had a surface area of 18.1 square centimeters and a depth of 5 centimeters. Cores were collected every two weeks during the midday low tide, on the same day as almost all other LTER FAUNA samples, except when water levels were prohibitively high. Macrobenthic animals (defined here as those animals retained on a 0.5 millimeter mesh screen) were identified to the lowest practical taxa. All dominant polychaetes were identified to species. Counts per core were converted to numbers per square meter of surface sediment and standardized for core depth (to 5 centimeters) where necessary. Physical data including tide level, surface water temperature, air temperature, temperature of the sediment/water interface, surface water salinity, and the observed depth of the reduction/oxidation layer were recorded at the same time as the macrobenthic collections." ;
