    dc:description "These data were created as part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office for Coastal Management's efforts to create an online mapping viewer called the Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer. It depicts potential sea level rise and its associated impacts on the nation's coastal areas. The purpose of the mapping viewer is to provide coastal managers and scientists with a preliminary look at sea level rise (slr) and coastal flooding impacts. The viewer is a screening-level tool that uses nationally consistent data sets and analyses. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help gauge trends and prioritize actions for different scenarios. The Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer may be accessed at: http://www.coast.noaa.gov/slr This metadata record describes the digital elevation model (DEM), which is a part of a series of DEMs produced for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office for Coastal Management's Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer described above. This DEM includes the best available data known to exist at the time of DEM creation that met project specifications, for mainland Virginia, this includes portions of the following counties: Alexandria, Arlington, Charles City, Chesapeake, Essex, Fairfax, Falls Church, Franklin City, Fredericksburg City, Gloucester, Hampton, Isle of Wight, James City, King and Queen, King George, King William, Lancaster, Mathews, Middlesex, New Kent, Newport News, Norfolk, Northumberland, Poquoson City, Portsmouth, Prince George, Prince William, Richmond, Southampton, Stafford, Suffolk, Surry, Sussex, Virginia Beach, Westmoreland, Williamsburg, and York. This DEM also includes the District of Columbia. The DEM is derived from the following lidar: 1.
