    dc:description "This report is based upon a study which was conducted during the period of March 1, 1969, through February 28, 1970. It was undertaken by the Arizona Bureau of Mines to fulfill the stipulation and conditions of a contract entered into by the Arizona Board of Regents, for the Arizona Bureau of Mines, with the Four Corners Regional Commission through the channel of a Technical Assistance Grant- Project No. FCRC 1095012 File No. 191-400-007. Under the terms of the contract, the Arizona Bureau of Mines has assembled data that are designed to assist in developing a fundamental understanding and a geological perspective of the occurrence of coal, petroleum, natural gas, helium and uranium in Arizona. It is hoped that this effort will serve those who are interested in the search for additional supplies of these potentially economic substances, and, in addition, will constitute the base for continuing efforts by the Arizona Bureau of Mines and other agencies concerned with the orderly development of these and other natural resources. Presentations are made in three parts, namely: (1) Coal; (2) Oil, Natural Gas, and Helium; and (3) Uranium. A unified bibliography, involving each of these commodities, is presented at the end of the report. Numerous tables and illustrations which concisely summarize significant data are included within each section, in the appendix, and as plates in the pocket at the back. 289 p." ;
