    dc:description "The Kansas Natural Resource Planner was designed to depict general areas of conservation sensitivity. It can be used to serve as a guide for the siting of wind farms, oil and gas fields, transmission lines, and other landscape-altering structures. The data here is an accumulation of custom data and data available from different organizations across the state, and is presented here as an organized, assessable, and unbiased resource for people. The information presented is based on the collective judgment of all the groups contributing and is not intended to be prejudiced in favor of, or against, any specific form of development. This map, and the data contained therein, is for general planning purposes only. Any final decisions should be based on actual field investigation as well as consultation with appropriate agencies and organizations (i.e. Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Kansas Biological Survey, The Kansas Natural Heritage Program, The Nature Conservancy) as a more thorough review and investigation of variables could impact a proposed project." ;

    dc:description "These data were collected for multiple purposes. First, they were gathered in support of conducting a condition assessment of fluvial waterbodies throughout the United States in support of the National Fish Habitat Action Plan (NFHAP). Second, these data were intended to be made available to NFHAP Partnerships as well as other users interested in acquiring consistently-organized information available characterizing river systems over larger regions. This work was supported by local, state, and federal partners of NFHAP including the U.S. Geological Survey.Because the condition assessment was conducted over such a large geographic region, a landscape approach was adopted for assessment which it assumed that anthropogenic disturbances as well as natural characteristics in the watersheds affect a given unit of habitat which in turn would affect fishes. It was necessary to use a landscape approach because landscape data are available for every location in of the United States whereas local measures of habitat or biological indicators of habitat condition are only available at a very small percentage of locations around the country.These data from the state of Kansas were downloaded from the National Fish Habitat Partnership Data Viewer: http://ecosystems.usgs.gov/fishhabitat/The NFHAP map viewer allows for the visualization of the primary results reported in Through a Fish s Eye: The Status of Fish Habitats in the United States 2010 at various spatial scales. An understanding of the procedures and methodology used to generate these results is a prerequisite to effectively using the data presented in this viewer.Other datasets, not produced by the Science and Data Team, have been included for informational purposes. Please see the metadata link for each of these ancillary layers for additional information.
