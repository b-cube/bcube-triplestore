    dc:description "This file contains the population weighted centroids for middle layer super output areas in England and Wales as at December 2011. The 2001 output areas and super output areas were maintained using 2011 Census data and are referred to as 2011 output areas and super output areas. In consultation with local authorities, the 7,201 middle layer SOA in England (6,791) and Wales (410) were built from groups of lower layer SOA and are constrained by the 2011 local authority district boundaries. They have a minimum of 5,000 residential population (an average of 7,700) and 2,000 households (an average of 3,200). Please note though that E02006781 (Isles of Scilly 001) is much smaller than this, but has been included as a pseudo-MSOA to give complete national coverage. Users should be aware of this when using MSOA for statistical presentation. The majority of middle layer SOA have not changed since 2004, allowing time-series comparison of statistics at that level. Each instance of 2011 OA, LSOA and MSOA has a population weighted centroid, that reflects the spatial distribution of the 2011 Census population in each instance of those geographies, referenced to a single summary point on the ground. Each population weighted centroid was calculated using a median centroid algorithm, which is less influenced by outliers than a mean centroid algorithm. The median algorithm used was the Median Center (sic) function in ArcGIS 10, run against the coordinates and the populations of each household in each OA, LSOA and MSOA. Where the calculated centroid fell outside the boundary of the area being calculated, or within two metres of the area boundary, it was moved to the nearest location at least two metres inside the area boundary. More information about how the Median Center algorithm works can be found in the link below. The centroids were created using Full Resolution Extent of the Realm boundaries. Please note that this product contains both Ordnance Survey and ONS Intellectual Property Rights. ONS have supplied within the zip file a csv file that shows the grid references for the middle layer super output area population weighted centroids. Version 2 has been updated to include Latitude and Longitude grid references. All files within the zip file that relate to this product will have 'COORD_V2' at the end of their file name to reflect the changes. Please note that the shapefile remains unchanged." ;
