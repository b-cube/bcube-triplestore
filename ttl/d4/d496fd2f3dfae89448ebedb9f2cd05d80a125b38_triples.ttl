    dc:description "TASK NAME: New England CMGP Sandy Lidar LiDAR Data Acquisition and Processing Production Task USGS Contract No. G10PC00057 Task Order No. G13PD00796 Woolpert Order No. 073667 CONTRACTOR: Woolpert, Inc. This data set is comprised of LiDAR point cloud data, raster DEM, hydrologic 3-d breaklines, raster intensity, survey control, project tile index, and project data extent which encompasses approximately 2120 square miles along with a 100 meter buffer over several areas in central to eastern Massachusetts. The coverage of the data includes slivers of areas that were missed by previous lidar acquisitions. LiDAR data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The LiDAR sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The LiDAR systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7m. The final products include files containing classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Collected swath files that were that were larger than 2GB were provided in multiple sub-swath files, each less than 2GB. The LiDAR data was provided in 1,500 meters x 1,500 meters tiles in the UTM projection. The LiDAR tile file names were derived from the southwest corner of each tile and are named based on the US National Grid. Product specifics can be found in the processing description section of this file. Ground conditions: No snow; Leaf off. The tide window requirements for the lidar data acquisition; Tidally impacted waters within the AOI are expected to be acquired at Predicted MLW +- 2 hours exclusive of neap tide.; The bare earth DEMs along the coast may have a variance in the water heights due to temporal differences during the lidar data acquisition and will be represented in DEM as a seam-like anomaly. This is especially true in areas of tidal flats. One coastal elevation was applied to entire project area. Due to differing acquisition dates and thus differing tide levels there will be areas in the DEM exhibiting what appears to be \"digging\" water features. Sometimes as much as approximately 1 meter. This was done to ensure that no coastal hydro feature was \"floating\" above ground surface. This coastal elevation will also affect connected river features wherein a sudden increase in flow will be observed in the DEM to accommodate the coastal elevation value; During Hydrologic breakline collection, Woolpert excluded obvious above-water piers or pier-like structures from the breakline placement. Some features extend beyond the apparent coastline and are constructed in a manner that can be considered an extension of the ground. These features were treated as ground during classification and subsequent hydrologic delineation. In all cases, professional practice was applied to delineate what appeared to be the coast based on data from multiple sources; Cranberry bogs are existent in the project. These are filled with shallow water for short periods during the year but were not collected as hydrologic features; Due to the many substructures and the complexity of the urban environment, interpolation and apparent \"divots\" (caused by tinning) may be evident in the surface of the DEM. Temporal differences from lidar collects in and around hydrologic features may manifest in the DEM as differing water levels. In all cases, professional practice was applied to best represent the topography. Data for the task order is referenced to the UTM Zone 19N, North American Datum of 1983 (2011), and NAVD88, in meters. However, a small portion of the AOI crossed into UTM 18 and this data is referenced to the UTM18N, North American Datum of 1983 (2011), and NAVD88 GEOID12A, in meters" ;
