    dc:description "Grover Heinrichs was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1925. As a child, he moved with his family through the western United States, the Philippines and South Africa. He was the Vice President of Heinrichs GEOEXploration, located in Tucson, Arizona, where his brother, Walter Heinrichs, Jr., was President. During his career as a geologist, he also worked or consulted for a number of other companies including the USGS, Phelps Dodge, United Technologies and Essex International. He was the Vice President of La Paz Mining Inc. from 1984 until the early '90s. He was a member of several professional organizations including the Arizona Geological Society, the Mining Club of the Southwest and the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration. This collection of files contains over 1,400 folders containing economic geology reports, maps, photos, correspondence, drill logs and other related materials. The focus of much of the information is on the western United States, particularly Arizona, but the collection also includes files on mining activity throughout the United States, foreign countries, and 82 mineral commodities. The collection is arranged by U.S. States, foreign countries, commodity files and lastly miscellaneous reports. A second donation arrived in 2002 which added materials for about two hundred existing folders and approximately two hundred new folders. These have been interfiled with the original materials, indicated by an additional character to the Resource ID." ;
