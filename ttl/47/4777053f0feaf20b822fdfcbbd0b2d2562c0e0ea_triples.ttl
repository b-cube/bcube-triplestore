    dc:description "Critical habitat constitutes areas considered essential for the conservation of a listed species. These data identify, in general critical habitat areas for the Northwest Atlantic Ocean Distinct Population Segment of Loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), providing notice to the public and managers of the importance of the areas to the conservation of this species. Special protections and/or restrictions are possible in areas where Federal funding, permits, licenses, authorizations, or actions occur or are required. We describe the physical and biological features (PBF), including: 1) nearshore reproductive habitat; 2) breeding habitat; 3) migratory habitat; 4) winter habitat; and 5) Sargassum habitat. 1) We describe the physical and biological features (PBF) of nearshore reproductive habitat as a portion of the nearshore waters adjacent to nesting beaches that are used by hatchlings to egress to the open-water environment as well as by nesting females to transit between beach and open water during the nesting season. Primary constituent elements (PCEs) that support this habitat are the following: (i) Nearshore waters directly off the highest density nesting beaches, as identified in 78 FR 43006, July 18, 2003, to 1.6 km (1 mile) offshore; (ii) Waters sufficiently free of obstructions or artificial lighting to allow transit through the surf zone and outward toward open water; and (iii) Waters with minimal man made structures that could promote predators (i.e., nearshore predator concentration caused by submerged and emergent offshore structures), disrupt wave patterns necessary for orientation, and/or create excessive longshore currents. 2) We describe the physical and biological features (PBF) of breeding habitat as sites with high densities of both male and female adult individuals during the breeding season. Primary constituent elements (PCEs) that support this habitat are the following: (i) High densities of reproductive male and female loggerheads; (ii) Proximity to primary Florida constricted migratory corridor; and (iii) Proximity to Florida nesting grounds. 3) We describe the physical and biological features (PBF) of constricted migratory habitat as high use migratory corridors that are constricted (limited in width) by land on one side and the edge of the continental shelf and Gulf Stream on the other side. Primary constituent elements (PCEs) that support this habitat are the following: (i) Constricted continental shelf area relative to nearby continental shelf waters that concentrate migratory pathways; and (ii) Passage conditions to allow for migration to and from nesting, breeding, and/or foraging areas. 4) We describe the physical and biological features (PBF) of winter habitat as warm water habitat south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina near the western edge of the Gulf Stream used by a high concentration of juveniles and adults during the winter months. Primary constituent elements (PCEs) that support this habitat are the following: (i) Water temperatures above 10 C from November through April; (ii) Continental shelf waters in proximity to the western boundary of the Gulf Stream; and (iii) Water depths between 20 and 100 meters. 5) We describe the physical and biological features (PBF) of Sargassum habitat as developmental and foraging habitat for young loggerheads where surface waters form accumulations of floating material, especially Sargassum. Primary constituent elements (PCEs) that support this habitat are the following: (i) Convergence zones, surface-water downwelling areas, the margins of major boundary currents (Gulf Stream), and other locations where there are concentrated components of the Sargassum community in water temperatures suitable for the optimal growth of Sargassum and inhabitance of loggerheads; (ii) Sargassum in concentrations that support adequate prey abundance and cover; (iii) Available prey and other material associated with Sargassum habitat including, but not limited to, plants and cyanobacteria and animals native to the Sargassum community such as hydroids and copepods; and (iv) Sufficient water depth and proximity to available currents to ensure offshore transport (out of the surf zone), and foraging and cover requirements by Sargassum for post-hatchling loggerheads, i.e., >10 meters depth." ;
