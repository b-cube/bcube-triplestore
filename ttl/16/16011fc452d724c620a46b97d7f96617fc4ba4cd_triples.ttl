    dc:description "This GIS data set represents the aids to navigation (ATONs) for the Seventh and Eighth Coast Guard Districts. This is a subset of all aids, to obtain a complete dataset visit (http://ocean.floridamarine.org/mrgis/Description_Layers_Marine.htm). The term \"aids to navigation\" refers to devices outside of a vessel that are used to assist mariners in determining their position, safe course or warn them of obstructions. Aids to navigation include light buoys and beacons. This data set includes federal aids, which are installed and maintained by the Coast Guard, as well as some privately maintained aids. This data set does not include unofficial (illegal) aids, such as PVC pipes, placed without permission. This data set is not certified for navigation and is not intended for navigation purposes. Each USCG district headquarters is responsible for updating its database on an as-needed basis. When existing aids are destroyed or relocated and new aids are installed, the database is updated. Each aid is assigned an official light listing number. The Light List is a document listing the status of the ATONs; it is regularly published and distributed. Interim changes to the Light List are published in local notices to mariners. In addition, the USCG broadcasts notices to mariners on the marine band radio as soon as changes in the status of individual aids are reported. Navigators should use the official notices to mariners to maintain current charts. Annual (or more frequent) updates of the Aids to Navigation database can be obtained from each USCG district headquarters." ;
