    dc:description "This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and nonsoil areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties. Note: All Minnesota SSURGO data sets are now in Version 2 format. This format is compatible with NRCS's Soil Data Viewer, a free extension for ArcView 3.x that allows users to more easily create soil-based thematic maps. - For more information about Soil Data Viewer, see http://www.itc.nrcs.usda.gov/soildataviewer/ Also note: This metadata record was created by the Minnesota Land Management Information Center to serve as a generic record for all SSURGO data sets within Minnesota. See the individual county metadata records created by NRCS for county-specific information; these records are included in the data set download files." ;
