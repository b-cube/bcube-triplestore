    dc:description "The Artillery Peak and Rawhide Wash 7 ' Quadrangles are located in southern Mohave County and northern La Paz County in western Arizona, and encompass Alamo Lake reservoir at the confluence of the Santa Maria and Big Sandy Rivers. New geologic mapping and map compilation for the two quadrangles, presented here, was done under the joint State-Federal STATEMAP program, as specified by the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992, and was jointly funded by the Arizona Geological Survey and the U.S. Geological Survey under STATEMAP assistance award G11AC20455. This map was compiled digitally using ESRI ArcGIS software. The Artillery Mountains and the northeastern flank of the Rawhide Mountains were partially mapped by Lasky and Webber (1949) and by Spencer et al. (1989). The northwestern part of the Rawhide Mountains was mapped by Yarnold and McDaniel (1992), and the entire range was mapped by Shackelford (1989). Two areas in the Rawhide Mountains were mapped in detail by Scott (2004). New mapping was done in unmapped areas, and to field check and improve mapping in previously mapped areas. Mapping by Lasky and Webber was not done on a modern topographic base, and their study area was almost entirely remapped. Previous mapping did not significantly differentiate Quaternary map units. For this mapping investigation, Quaternary units were differentiated in detail for entire map area. Georeferenced aerial-photograph imagery was used extensively for mapping Quaternary deposits." ;
