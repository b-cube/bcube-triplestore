    dc:description "CORMP was initiated as a research and observation program focusing on the collection of data applicable to physical and ecological predictive models, fisheries sustainability, and habitat quality. CORMP consists of four focus areas: Ocean Observations, Data Management, Ecosystem Research and Modeling, and Outreach and Education that operate synergistically to: 1) provide a regional hub (SE US) in a national observing system; 2) collect and disseminate physical and ecological data; and 3) engage regional partners, stakeholders and end-users in the development and implementation of a sustainable coastal-ocean observing program. CORMP capitalizes on a combination of instrumented moorings, remote sensing and ecosystem models, and traditional ship-based observations to establish baseline conditions, identify responses to stochastic events, predict and verify long-term trends and identify linkages among coastal ocean ecosystem components. The information collected by CORMP help researchers determine a mechanistic understanding of factors affecting productivity in the coastal ocean in the region and will provide information that can be and is directly used in local-to federal fisheries management. Further, information collected by CORMP will be used by partner organizations to provide a real-time forecasting. The operational area for the CORMP observing network extends from estuaries (including the Cape Fear River Estuary and it's plume) to the coast, across the continental margin to the Gulf Stream, and from the SC/NC border to north of Cape Lookout. <1> Mooring: Core variables collected at each mooring includes water temperature and salinity, water column currents, surface wave directional spectra data. On some selected mooring stations, CORMP also measure turbidity and fluorescence. <2> Cruise: We sample the cape fear river plume every month by collecting data with a YSI-6820 Water Quality Sonde. This instrument measures (Temperature, Salinity, pH, Conductivity, Dissolved Oxygen, and Turbidity.) We collect Total Nitrate, Total phosphate, Nitrate, Phosphate, Ammonium and Chlorophyll a. Zooplankton samples are also collected at four of the plume stations. Our Onslow Bay sampling cruises are conducted bi-monthly. We sample six stations, each approximately five nautical miles apart, beginning at the Masonboro Inlet sea buoy and extending out to approximately 27 miles offshore. Our most offshore sampling station (OB27) also serves as the location for a fixed underwater instrument mooring. Basic data including time (GMT), latitude, longitude, water depth, sea surface temperature, weather conditions, and sea state are noted upon arrival at every station. When on station, scientists take measurements of physical parameters (temperature, currents, salinity, etc.), light attenuation and collect water samples for analysis of nutrients, phytoplankton pigments, and CDOM using a Seabird SBE-25 CTD rosette." ;
