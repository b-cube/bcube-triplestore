    dc:description "The following is excerpted from an online document produced by the U.S. Census Bureau pertaining to cartographicboundary files of congressional districts:\"Congressional districts (CDs) are the 435 areas from which people are elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.After the apportionment of congressional seats among the states, based on census population counts, each state isresponsible for establishing CDs for the purpose of electing representatives. Each CD is to be as equal in populationto all other CDs in the state as practicable.The CDs in effect at the time of Census 2000 were those of the 106th Congress, whose session began in January 1999.The boundaries were identical to those reflected in the 107th CD boundary files. The CDs for the 103rd Congress(January 1993 to 1995) were the first to reflect redistricting based on the 1990 census. The 103rd CDs remained ineffect through Census 2000, except where a state initiative or a court-ordered redistricting required a change. Sixstates redistricted for the 104th Congress (Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, South Carolina, and Virginia), fivestates redistricted for the 105th Congress (Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Texas), and three states(New York, North Carolina, and Virginia) redistricted for the 106th Congress. In North Carolina the \"1998 CongressionalPlan A\" was used for the 1998 congressional elections. It was created in response to a court ruling which held the 1997plan, \"97 House/Senate Plan A,\" unconstitutional. These boundaries are reflected in the 106th CD boundary files. TheSupreme Court has since reversed that lower court ruling and the 1997 plan, \"97 House/Senate Plan A,\" (reflected inthe 107th CD boundary files) was used for the 2000 North Carolina congressional elections. The 108th Congress is thefirst to reflect reapportionment and redistricting based on Census 2000 data.\"" ;
