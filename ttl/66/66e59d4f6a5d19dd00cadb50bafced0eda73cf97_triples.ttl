    dc:description "Point locations representing observations of mountain plover (Charadrius montanus) feeding and roosting flocks (and occasional individuals) documented during an Audubon California-sponsored statewide census (1994), and Department of Fish and Game-sponsored surveys during 1998 and 2002. All records contain data and information gathered as part of one of these survey efforts. The 1994 Audubon California census was an attempt to locate and document all wintering mountain plovers in California. Volunteers were assigned to areas believed to either support mountain plover wintering habitat or harbor wintering birds. Survey assignments were based on local knowledge and coordinated through the Audubon California office. Department of Fish and Game survey efforts (1998 and 2002) used a similar approach but drew from a broader pool of skilled observers solicited through bird clubs, internet birding discussion forums, and direct contact with university and museum ornithologists. For each survey, observers were instructed to document the area covered during the survey (assuming 1/2 buffer centered over linear survey routes), the number of birds observed, gross habitat and vegetative characteristics, conspecifics, and weather and visibility conditions. For additional detail of methods employed, results, and discussion and analysis, see http://www.dfg.ca.gov/hcpb/info/bm_research/bm_pdf Although labeled as a census (defined as a complete count of all individuals), the 1994 effort was similar in scope to the 1998 and 2002 Department surveys in that surveyors attempted to visit promising sites but did not cover the entire California mountain plover range or sample potentially suitable habitat. Each record in the database represents an observation of a feeding or roosting flock and associated vegetative and weather conditions. In addition, each record documents an observer name (used to calculate observer consistency and bias), date, time and place of the observati" ;
