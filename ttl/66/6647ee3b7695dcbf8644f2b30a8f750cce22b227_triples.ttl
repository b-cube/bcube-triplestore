    dc:description "Meteorological data were collected on a daily basis from December 1, 1986 through March 3, 1996 at the Oyster Landing Research site in the North Inlet Estuary, Georgetown County, SC. Data recorded include: maximum and minimum daily values for air temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure; current (instantaneous) air temperature; and daily rainfall totals. Protocols for data collection changed over the course of the database, see the Methodology section for more information. For the entire data set, relative humidity and barometric pressure data were recorded automatically on charts. Daily maximum and minimum values were interpreted from the charts based on the 24-hour period 0000 to 2400. For most of the data set, daily rainfall totals and all current (instantaneous), maximum, and minimum air temperature data were derived from visual inspection of the rain gauge or thermometers, recorded by hand, and based on a 1000 to 1000 daily time period. During the latter portion of the data set, maximum and minimum air temperature and rainfall values were interpreted from charts for the 0000 to 2400 24-hour time period. During this time, no \"current\" air temperature data were recorded. Readings were taken every day of the year, except when individual sensors were not functioning." ;
