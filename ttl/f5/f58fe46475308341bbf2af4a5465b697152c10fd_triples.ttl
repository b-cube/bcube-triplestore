    dc:description "The \"Darfur Damaged and Destroyed Villages\" dataset describes the condition of villages in the Darfur region of Sudan that the U.S. Government has confirmed as either \"damaged\" or \"destroyed\" between the time period February 2003 to December 2010. Additionally, villages the are confirmed to have \"No Damage\" are also reported. Using the \"Darfur Damaged and Destroyed Villages\" dataset responsibly Monitoring the status of villages in Darfur, Sudan is an ongoing process. After information on the level of damage of villages is collected and confirmed, that information goes into a data table in which entire villages are categorized as not damaged, damaged, or destroyed. This categorization process is not an exact science, but the methodology employed is a conservative one; the database only includes records of damage and destruction about which there is a high degree of confidence. All estimates about the number of destroyed structures and total structures are approximate. Wherever possible, the year or year range of damage is included in the database field associated with a particular village, though the database does not contain precise dates of damage or destruction. On occasion the \"Yr_Confirm\" field will include a date range of two different years, for example \"2003/2004\". This indicates that an exact year of the attack could not be determined, and should not be interpreted that there were multiple attacks. The \"Yr_Confirm\" field is also split into two fields \"Yr_Range1\" and \"Yr_Range2\". HIU Modifications The Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) of the U.S. Department of State has reformatted the original dataset, in an attempt to increase its usability for quantitative analysis. The original \"Structures\" data field was parsed into three seperate fields: \"Aprox_Str1\", \"Aprox_Str2\", and \"Sec_Town\". All efforts were made to ensure these data fields matched the original, but if a difference is found, please defer to the original \"Structures\" field. As with the original \"Structures\" data field, all counts are approximate. Additionally the \"Yr_Confirm\" field was also parsed. In the situation where an exact year could not be determined, the \"Yr_Confirm\" field was split into two data fields \"Yr_Range1\" and \"Yr_Range2\". This was done solely with the intent of making numerical calculations easier and should not be interpreted as either additional precision regarding the year of attack or that two seperate attacks occurred. Again, if a discrepancy between the \"Yr_Confirm\" field and the \"Yr_Range1\" and \"Yr_Range2\" fields occur, defer to the original \"Yr_Confirm\" data. When the HIU receives further information on the status of more villages throughout the region, we will distribute it as appropriate. This data can be sourced as \"U.S. Government.\"" ;
