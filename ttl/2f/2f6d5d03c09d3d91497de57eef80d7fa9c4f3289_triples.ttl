    dc:description "Gap analysis uses the predicted distributions of native vertebrate species to evaluate their conservation status relative to existing land management, utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology. Previous to this effort there were no maps available, digital or otherwise, showing the likely present-day distribution of species by habitat across their ranges in Alaska. Besides gap analysis, the maps of vertebrate species distributions and associated information may be used to answer a wide variety of management, planning, and research questions relating to individual species or groups of species. GAP distribution models represent the areas where species are predicted to occur based on habitat associations. GAP distribution models are the spatial arrangement of environments suitable for occupation by a species. In other words, a species distribution is created using a model to predict areas suitable for occupation within a species range. To represent these suitable environments, AKGAP compiled existing occurrence data, where available, and compiled additional data where needed. Habitat associations were based on Landfire Land Cover data of ecological systems, elevation data, hydrological characteristics, forest edge, and ecotone widths. Distribution models are 60 meter raster data and delimited by species range polygons (4th level hydrologic unit versions). AKGAP used the best information available at the time to create these species distribution models. It is important to stress that the information on species habitat associations, elevation limits and statewide geographical distributions compiled in this atlas were collected for the purposes of statewide and regional analyses of biodiversity conservation. This information was not intended for the purpose of determining a measure of abundance, health or condition of populations of any species listed herein. Wherever possible we have tried to detail the circumstances where our mapping procedures were insufficient to accurately represent the geographic distribution of particular species. Deductive and inductive modeling techniques were used to produce GAP distribution models. Combined models were created as an intersection of where there was agreement between the two model types. Deductive distribution modeling followed the traditional, land cover-based procedures described by Csuti and Crist (1998), to produce models. Inductive models were derived using known points of occurrence and their intersection with a suite of environmental parameters. The inductive modeling process included occurrence data processing and filtering, ancillary data layer development or refinement, and the application of the Maximum Entropy algorithm (MaxEnt version 3.3.1) to produce models." ;
