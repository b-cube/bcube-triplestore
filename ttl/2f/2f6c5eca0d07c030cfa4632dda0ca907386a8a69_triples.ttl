    dc:description "Connecticut Geographic Place is a point feature-based layer that includes cultural features such as airports, bridges, government buildings, hospitals, railroad stations and schools. The layer is based on information from lists from various sources available during 2008. The layer represents conditions at a particular point in time. The layer includes public and private airports, major bridges, the State Capitol, acute care hospitals and medical centers, railroad stations serving three major railroad companies and most public and some private educational institutions in the categories of elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, colleges and universities. It does not include other types of schools such as kindergartens or business schools, a complete set of bridges or government buildings other than the State Capitol. Features are point locations that represent the approximate center location of the feature as seen on the Connecticut 2004 Orthophotographs. The layer was created for the purpose of labeling geographic places on maps and is not intended to be a complete list of any of the categories included in the layer. Attribute information is comprised of NAME to uniquely identify individual features, TOWN to provide general location and CLASS and CATEGORY to encode type information and cartographically represent (symbolize) point features on a map. This data is not updated." ;
