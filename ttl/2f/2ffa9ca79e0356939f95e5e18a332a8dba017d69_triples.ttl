    dc:description "Seine samples of the nekton community were taken every 2 weeks with a 6-millimeter mesh bag seine at low tide, in an intertidal creek pool in the Oyster Landing basin, a finger creek off Crab Haul Creek. From April 15, 1983 through April 19, 1993, two seine tows were completed during each sampling event. Initially [samples l through 26 (April 15, 1983 through April 16, 1984)], two tows were completed at two sites, OA and OB. For the remainder of the database, both tows were conducted only at the OA site, which was renamed OL. From May 4, 1993 through the end of this database, the sample was reduced to one seine tow. The seine collections were taken to a processing laboratory where the field technicians identified and sorted the nekton to species (when possible). Total number (abundance), length, and weight (biomass) measurements for each species were recorded. Between 1984 and 1988, collection efficiency data were obtained seasonally in order to determine the efficacy of the regular sampling procedures. On efficiency sample dates, an additional 12 to 14 sweeps (tows) of the low tide pool were made following the standard tows. For the last two efficiency dates, the 15 sweeps were followed with a rotenone treatment to ensure that all individuals present were collected. All of the efficiency data, as well as physical data (water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, etc.) collected prior to each sample event, were included in the database as ancillary data files. Species length/weight and Callinectes spp. sex data occur periodically in the early to mid-1980s raw data sheets and in the early LTER digital files. These data are not available in the final rescued 2005 database or on the web site. However, these data can be attained by accessing: 1) the raw data sheets stored at the Baruch Marine Field Laboratory (BMFL), 2) the scanned images of these sheets which are archived on the OL.LowTideNekton.1983-2003.RAW Archive CD, or 3) the MAINFRAME directory/files on the OL.LowTideNekton.1983-2003.PROCESS CD." ;
