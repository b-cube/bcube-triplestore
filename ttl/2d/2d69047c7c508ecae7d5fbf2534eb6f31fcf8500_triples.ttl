    dc:description "This layer is a subset of the zoning boundaries for the City and County of Denver, Colorado to reflect the zone districts in the new code that permit general industrial food related activity as a primary use. General Manufacturing, Fabrication, and Assembly is a subset of the Manufacturing and Production use category (as defined in Section 11.12.5.3). Manufacturing and Production includes manufacturing and production firms involved in the manufacturing, processing, fabrication, packaging, or assembly of goods. Natural, human-made, raw, secondary, or partially completed materials may be used. Products may be finished or semi-finished and are generally made for the wholesale market, for transfer to other plants, or to order for firms or consumers. Goods are generally not displayed or sold on site, but if so, they are a subordinate part of sales. Relatively few customers come to the manufacturing site. More specifically, general manufacturing, fabrication, and assembly includes the following type establishments (Section 11.12.5.3.B.2): a manufacturing establishment primarily engaged in the fabrication or assembly of products from prestructured materials or components; or a manufacturing establishment whose operations include storage of materials; processing, fabrication, or assembly of products; and loading and unloading of new materials and finished products, and does not produce or utilize in large quantities as an integral part of the manufacturing process, toxic, hazardous, or explosive materials. Because of the nature of its operations and products, little or no noise, odor, vibration, glare, and/or air and water pollution is produced, and, therefore, there is minimal impact on surrounding properties. This definition includes all uses or products for Food and kindred products, except those noted as heavy manufacturing. The zoning boundaries data layer is governed by ordinance and is only changed accordingly. Please note: this layer applies to the new code only. Zones carried over from the 1956 zoning code, as well as 'DIA', 'OS-A', 'PUD', 'PUD-G' zones, need to be reviewed individually." ;
