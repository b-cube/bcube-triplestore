    dc:description "2/6/15 An extension of ND 46 has been added to the State Highway system. The segment of roadway east of I-29 was removed from the State Highway system in 1977. As of May 2011, a document showing a maintenance agreement with a county, as required by State Law to transfer responsibility, has not been found. The Fargo District has been doing basic maintenance on this segment. The segment of road that begins at I-29 and extends to the east until the intersection CMC 0957 is added to the State Highway system. The addition will result in an increase of 0.4 miles.
