    dc:description "Aerial Information Systems (AIS) and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) Vegetation Classification and Mapping Program (VegCAMP) with assistance from the California Native Plant Society (CNPS) created a fine-scale vegetation map of portions of the Mojave and Colorado Deserts in California. Approximately six million acres spanning desert portions of Inyo, Kern, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, and Imperial Counties were mapped between 2011 and 2012. The primary purpose was to develop an accurate vegetation map for the California desert as it pertains to renewable energy sources and conservation opportunities, helping planners identify high quality habitat and rare communities. The vegetation classification follows Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) and National Vegetation Classification Standards (NVCS). The classification is based on previous survey and classification work. The map was produced applying heads-up digitizing techniques using a base of true-color and color infrared 2010 one-meter National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery in conjunction with ancillary data and imagery sources. Map polygons were assessed for Vegetation Type, Percent Cover, Exotics, Development Disturbance, and other attributes. The minimum mapping unit (MMU) is 10 acres; exceptions are made for wetlands and certain wash types (which were mapped to a one or five acre MMU) and areas characterized as Land Use polygons (which were mapped to a 2.5 acre MMU). Field reconnaissance and accuracy assessment enhanced map quality. A total of 46,803 map polygons representing 137 vegetation map classes were developed. The overall accuracy assessment rating for the final vegetation map was 84.59 percent." ;
