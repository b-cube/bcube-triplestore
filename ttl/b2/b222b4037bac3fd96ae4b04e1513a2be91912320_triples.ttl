    dc:description "This vector data set represents the Seaward Landfast Ice Edge (SLIE) along the coast of Northern Alaska (West of Barrow) and Northwest Canada (East to the Mackenzie Delta) for the study area which ranges from approximately 133 to 160 degrees West and 68 to 72.5 degrees North. Landfast sea ice is a seasonal phenomena in the Alaskan Arctic and throughout its annual existence, between formation in late fall and break-up in late spring, it is shaped by a range of thermodynamic and dynamic forces (Barry et al. 1979; Shapiro and Metzner, 1989). The most apparent changes are those in landfast ice area and extent when floes of ice attach to and break off from its seaward edge. The position of the SLIE over the course of the year generally advances offshore to a stable position in mid-winter before retreating with the onset of spring. However, higher frequency changes in position also occur on timescales of days to weeks, which are generally small but occasionally affect the full width of the landfast ice. The location and stability of the SLIE at any point in time affects the activities of people and wildlife in the coastal arctic as it marks the boundary between stationary, continuous sea ice and drifting deforming pack ice. It is a vital consideration for people hunting or working on the ice in determining where food sources might be or where spilt oil might go. Since landfast ice occupies the shallowest water in the arctic, its presence or absence is also important for coastal process such as erosion and sediment entrainment." ;
