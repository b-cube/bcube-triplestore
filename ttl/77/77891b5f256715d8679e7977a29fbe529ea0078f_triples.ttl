    dc:description "This is large-scale vector topographic map data for parts of the upper Clark Fork basin. The data cover a 2000-foot wide strip along the Clark Fork from Milltown to Warm Springs, the Deer Lodge Valley between Warm Springs and Gregson, the city of Anaconda, the floodplain of Silver Bow Creek between Gregson and Butte, and the city of Butte. The data were digitized using photgrammetric techniques by Horizons, Inc., from aerial photos taken between 1984 and 1991. There are two copies of the data. One copy is an ESRI file geodatabase partitioned into feature datasets according to the photography dates. This data includes the text annotation provided by Horizons. The other copy is in ESRI shapefile format and does not include the annotation. The data themes include buildings, roads, railroads, hydrography, contour lines, poles, fences, spot elvations, control points, boreholes, pipelines, trees, and wooded areas. The area covered by data from various dates is shown in the Topo_ClarkFork_1a.gif image and Photo_Index dataset that are included in the distribution. Because the data were collected over a period of years, there are some areas that were digitized multiple times. To create a primary dataset that does not contain multiple representations of the same objects, the overlapping areas were removed from some of the feature classes and saved into a secondary \"overlap\" data collection. These are in the folders or feature datasets whose names start with \"X\", \"Y\", and \"Z\". These data were formerly available from the Montana State Library web site but were removed because they are potentially out of date. Please contact the Federal Superfund Bureau of the Montana Department of Environmental Quality if you want these data so they may tell you if newer or better data are available. If the data are not available from the Department of Environmental Quality, you may request a copy from the Montana State Library data archive." ;
