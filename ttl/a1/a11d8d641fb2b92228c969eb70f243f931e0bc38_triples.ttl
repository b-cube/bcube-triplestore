    dc:description "The recent proliferation of oil and natural gas energy development in southwest Wyoming has stimulated the need to understand wildlife responses to this development. Central to many wildlife assessments is the use of geospatial methods that rely on digital representation of energy infrastructure. An important but unavailable infrastructure layer has been surface disturbance of the well pad scars associated with oil and natural gas extraction. To provide a digital baseline of this surface disturbance, we extracted visible oil and gas well pad scars from 1-m NAIP imagery (National Agriculture Imagery Program) acquired in 2009 for a 7.7 million-hectare (MHA) region of southwest Wyoming. Scars include the pad area where wellheads, pumps, and storage facilities reside, and the surrounding area that is scraped and denuded of vegetation during the establishment of the pad. Also, scars containing tanks, compressors, and the storage of oil and gas related equipment, and produced-water ponds were opportunistically collected. Our extraction method was a two-step process starting with automated extraction followed by manual inspection and clean up. We used available well point information to guide manual clean up and to derive estimates of year of origin and duration of activity on a pad scar. We also derived estimates of the proportion of non-vegetated area on a scar using a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index derived using 1-m NAIP imagery. We extracted 16,973 pad scars of which 15,318 were oil and gas well pads. Digital representation of pad scars along with time-stamps of activity and estimates of non-vegetated area provides important baseline (circa 2009) data for assessments of wildlife responses, land-use trends, and disturbance-mediated pattern assessments." ;
