    dc:description "The Eagle quadrangle covers an area that straddles the Eagle River and Interstate 70 (I-70) and it includes the town of Eagle, Colo., which is located in the southwestern part of the quadrangle, just south of I-70 and the Eagle River, about 37 km west of Vail, Colo. The map area is part of the I-70 urban corridor, which is experiencing rapid and escalating urban growth. Geologic mapping along this corridor is needed for ongoing land-use planning. A variety of rocks and deposits characterize the map area and areas nearby. Sedimentary rocks present in the map area range in age from Pennsylvanian rocks, which were deposited in the ancestral Eagle basin during the formation of the ancestral Rocky Mountains, to Late Cretaceous rocks that were deposited just prior to the formation of the present Rocky Mountains. The Pennsylvanian rocks in the map area include a thick sequence of evaporitic rocks (Eagle Valley Evaporite). These evaporitic rocks are commonly complexly folded throughout the southern part of the quadrangle where they are exposed. In general, in the central and northern parts of the quadrangle, the sedimentary rocks overlying the evaporite dip gently to moderately northward. Consequently, the youngest sedimentary rocks (Late Cretaceous rocks) are exposed dipping gently to the north in the northern part of the quadrangle; landslide complexes are widespread along the northerly dipping, dip slopes in shaly rocks of the Cretaceous sequence in the northeastern part of the map area. During the Early Miocene, basaltic volcanism formed extensive basaltic flows that mantled the previously deformed and eroded sedimentary rocks. Erosional remnants of the basaltic flows are preserved in the southeastern, west-central, and north-central parts of the map area. Some of these basaltic flows are faulted and downdropped in a manner that suggests they were downdropped in areas where large volumes of the underlying evaporitic rocks were removed from the subsurface, beneath the basaltic rocks, by dissolution or flowage of the evaporite in the subsurface. Quaternary and late Tertiary(?) surficial deposits in the map area consist mainly of Quaternary alluvium and colluvium, late and middle Pleistocene terrace gravels of the Eagle River, Miocene(?) gravel remnants of the ancestral Eagle River and its tributaries, and Pleistocene to recent mass movement deposits that include landslides and debris flows. Potential geologic hazards in the map area include landslides, debris flows, rockfalls, local flooding, ground subsidence, and expansive and corrosive soils." ;
