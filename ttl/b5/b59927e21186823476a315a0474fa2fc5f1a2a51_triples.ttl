    dc:description "The Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESA's) scheme was first introduced in 1987. The ESA scheme was introduced in Scotland to help conserve specially designated areas of the countryside where the landscape, wildlife or historic interest is of particular importance and where these environmental features can be affected by farming operations. ESA's were designated under powers given to the Secretary of State in the Agriculture Act 1986. In addition Parliament approved individual Statutory Instruments which set out the terms and conditions for each designated area. There are 10 ESA's currently operating in Scotland" ;

    dc:description "National Scenic Areas are Scotland's only national landscape designation. They are those areas of land considered of national significance on the basis of their outstanding scenic interest which must be conserved as part of the country's natural heritage. They have been selected for their charachteristic features of scenery comprising a mixture of richly diverse landscapes including prominent landforms, coastline, sea and fresh water lochs, rivers, woodland and moorlands. NSA's were identified by the former Countryside Commission for Scotland and they are described in \"Scotland's Scenic Heritage\", published in 1978. No new areas have been identified since then. Most areas are in private ownership although the Forestry Commission has some sizeable land holdings. There are 40 NSA'a in Scotland covering 1 million hectares, which is 12.7% of Scotland." ;
