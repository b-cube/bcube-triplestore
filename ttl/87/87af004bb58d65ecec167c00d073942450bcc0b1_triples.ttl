    dc:description "The purpose of this project is to assess the energetic values of Pacific salmon with emphasis on Chinook salmon, as prey to southern resident killer whales. The Ecotoxicology Program, in collaboration with the Environmental Assessment Program and staff from the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, is conducting a coast wide assessment of energy content (Kcal/kg and Kcal/fish) in 5 species of Pacific salmon over the geographic range where they would be routinely encountered by resident killer whales. Kcal/kg and Kcal/fish were measured in Chinook salmon from 6 populations originating from streams along the west coast of North America, ranging from northern British Columbia to Puget Sound and northern California. Additionally, major population-complexes or multiple geographically-separated population-complexes of sockeye, coho, pink, and chum salmon were sampled to provide a comparison of energy value among Pacific salmon species. Major findings will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. The Northwest Regional Office Protected Resource Division uses this information, along with additional information on abundance of salmon and the energetic needs of southern resident killer whales, to assess the role of salmon fishery on the recovery efforts for southern resident killer whales. This project was originally designed as a stand-alone project, and is one component of a larger killer whale prey project that assesses the quality of prey of southern resident killer whales in terms of their contaminants and energetic content. Measures of lipid, protein, ash and moisture content of whole-body samples of five species of Pacific salmon." ;
