    dc:description "A current, accurate spatial representation of all historic properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places is of interest to Federal agencies, the National Park Service, State Historic and Tribal Historic Preservation Offices, local government and certified local governments, consultants, academia, and the interested public. This interest stems from the regulatory processes of managing cultural resources that are consistent with the National Historic Preservation Act as Amended (NHPA), the National Environmental Policy Act as Amended, the Archaeological Resources Protection Act, and other laws related to cultural resources. The regulations promulgating these laws require the use of spatial data in support of various decisions and actions related to cultural resource management.The information contained in the feature attribute tables for this dataset is not descriptive. Rather the tables document how the data was created, where it came from, who created the data, what map parameters were used e.g. source scale, source accuracy, source coordinate system etc. Also included is information on the name of the resource, status of the resource i.e. does it still exist, is it restricted and what if any constraints are associated with the resource. Please note that each historic property listed on the National Register has its own nominating history and therefore location information collected in the nominating process is different from one property to another. Therefore metadata has been created for each listed historic property to inform the potential user of the history or lineage of the spatial information associated with the historic property. Locations associated with restricted National Register of Historic Places properties are not included in this GeoDatabase and must be requested from the National Park Service, National Register Program.The metadata in the feature attribute table are compliant with the National Park Service s Cultural Resource Spatial Data Transfer Standards. These standards were created to facilitate the exchange of spatial data within a variety of contexts, particularly Sections 106 and 110 of NHPA as well as in the context of disaster recovery events. Often locations of National Register listed properties are needed in these situations. The National Register Geo-spatial dataset is organized as a geo-database with feature class definitions based on the National Register s Resource Type designations i.e. historic buildings, historic districts, historic structures, historic objects, and historic sites. The definitions of these types can be found in National Register Bulletin 16A and in the metadata statements for each feature class." ;
