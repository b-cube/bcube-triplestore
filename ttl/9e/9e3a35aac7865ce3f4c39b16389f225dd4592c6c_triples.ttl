    dc:description "This digital elevation model (DEM) is a part of a series of DEMs produced for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office for Coastal Management's Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer. The DEMs created for this project were developed using the NOAA National Weather Service's Weather Forecast Office (WFO) boundaries. The DEM includes the best available lidar known to exist at the time of DEM creation that met project specifications for the Philadelphia WFO, which includes the coastal counties of Delaware and New Jersey, and the counties in New Jersey and Pennsylvania that are along the Delaware River. The portion of the DEM that falls in Delaware is derived from the following lidAR datasets: 1. Kent and New Castle Counties - flown over 7 missions between March 31 - April 5, 2007 as part of the Delaware Coastal Lidar Program. 2. Sussex County - acquired in March 2005 using the NASA Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL) platform. In Delaware, the hydrographic breaklines used in the creation of the DEM were delineated from lidar intensity imagery generated from the lidar datasets. The portion of the DEM that falls in New Jersey is derived from mulitple sources. Lidar data for the counties of Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester, Mercer, Middlesex, Salem, and Somerset were acquired from the New Jersey statewide lidar program. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) provided lidar for Atlantic, Cumberland, and Ocean County, as well as southern Salem and southern Monmouth county. Lidar data collected in 2011 for Camden and Burlington County was provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). For the Newark urban area, including Bergen, Essex, Hudson, northern Monmouth, Passaic, and Union County, the DEM was derived from elevation data acquired from the USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED). Hydrographic breaklines were delineated from lidar intensity imagery generated from the lidar datasets. Breaklines for the Newark urban area were delineated from 2007 orthoimagery acquired from the New Jersey Geographic Information Network. The portion of the DEM that falls in Pennsylvania is derived from lidar data acquired from the PAMAP program. Lidar data for the three counties include Bucks, Delaware and Philadelphia, were flown during the spring of 2008. Hydrographic breaklines were delineated from the lidar intensity imagery generated from the lidar datasets. The DEM is hydro flattened such that water elevations are less than or equal to 0 meters. The DEM is referenced vertically to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) with vertical units of meters and horizontally to the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The resolution of the DEM is approximately 10 meters." ;
