    dc:description "This data set provides industrial-scale onshore wind turbine locations, corresponding facility information, and turbine technical specifications, in the United States to March 2014. The database has nearly 49,000 wind turbine records that have been collected, digitized, locationally verified, and internally quality assured and quality controlled. Turbines from the Federal Aviation Administration Digital Obstacle File, product date March 2, 2014, were used as the primary source of turbine data points. Verification of the position of turbines was done by visual interpretation using high-resolution aerial imagery in ESRI ArcGIS Desktop. Turbines without Federal Aviation Administration Obstacle Repository System (FAA ORS) numbers were visually identified and supplemental points were added to the collection. A locational error of plus or minus 10 meters for turbine positions was estimated. Wind farm facility names were identified from publicly available facility data sets. Facility names were then used in a web search of additional industry publications and press releases to attribute additional turbine information (such as manufacturer, model, and technical specifications of wind turbines). Wind farm facility location data from various wind and energy industry sources were used to search for and digitize turbines not in existing databases. Technical specifications assigned to were based on the make and model as described in literature, in the Federal Aviation Administration Digital Obstacle File, and information from the turbine manufacturers' websites. Some facility and turbine information did not exist or was difficult to obtain. Thus, uncertainty may be present. That uncertainty was rated and a confidence was recorded for both location and attribution data quality." ;
