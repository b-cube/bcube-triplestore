    dc:description "This layer is a subset of the zoning boundaries for the City and County of Denver, Colorado to reflect the zone districts in the new code that permit heavy industrial food related activity as a primary use. Heavy Manufacturing, Fabrication, and Assembly is a subset of the Manufacturing and Production use category (as defined in Section 11.12.5.3). Manufacturing and Production includes manufacturing and production firms involved in the manufacturing, processing, fabrication, packaging, or assembly of goods. Natural, human-made, raw, secondary, or partially completed materials may be used. Products may be finished or semi-finished and are generally made for the wholesale market, for transfer to other plants, or to order for firms or consumers. Goods are generally not displayed or sold on site, but if so, they are a subordinate part of sales. Relatively few customers come to the manufacturing site. More specifically, heavy manufacturing, fabrication, and assembly includes the following type establishments (Section 11.12.5.3.B.3): a manufacturing establishment whose operations include storage of materials; processing, fabrication, or assembly of products; and loading and unloading of new materials and finished products; Toxic, hazardous, or explosive materials may be produced or used in large quantities as an integral part(s) of the manufacturing process; or Noise, odor, dust, vibration, or visual impacts, as well as potential public health problems in the event of an accident, could impact adjacent properties. This definition includes, but is not limited to, all uses or products in the following SIC groups and the following uses: 2011 Meat packing plants; 2015 Poultry slaughtering; 2061 Sugar cane; 2062 Sugar cane refining; 2063 Sugar beet refining; 2076 Vegetable oil mill; 2077 Animal and marine fats and oils; 2082 Malt beverage manufacturing of over sixty thousand (60,000) barrels per year; 2084 Wines, brandy and brandy spirits; and 2085 Distilled and blended liquors. The zoning boundaries data layer is governed by ordinance and is only changed accordingly. Please note: this layer applies to the new code only. Zones carried over from the 1956 zoning code, as well as 'DIA', 'OS-A', 'PUD', 'PUD-G' zones, need to be reviewed individually." ;
