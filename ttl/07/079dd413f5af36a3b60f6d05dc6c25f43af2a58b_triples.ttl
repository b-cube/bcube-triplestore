    dc:description "This data set shows all the on-water or very nearshore avian resources used for nesting and roosting by specific bird species of interest around the Salton Sea. Initial data capture was by Ken Sturm, but later supplemented by other workers, including Kathy Molina. GPS readings, text descriptions and imagery were used to generate polygons of interest. In some cases, the features were essentially points (specific duck blinds, or a partially submerged barge), but were converted into polygons by buffering. Other features were encompassed by GPS readings, and still others were interpreted from aerial imagery. All sites were attributed according to whether the site was used historically for nesting or roosting by any of a suite of specific bird species, and particularly to indicate if the site was used in 1999, when the surveys were made. These features also constitute on-water hazards for navigational purposes. Disclaimer: DFG received this dataset from the University of Redlands please contact them directly with any questions." ;
