    dc:description "\"The northern California continental shelf can be subdivided into three shelf sections based on sediment characteristics: the Klamath River shelf, from Point St. George to Patricks Point; the Eel River shelf, from Patricks Point to Eel Canyon; and the shelf south of Eel Canyon. Three sediment types predominate on the shelf. The nearshore zone, to a depth of 55 to 65 meters, is covered by fine to very fine sands that are transported by waves. The mid-shelf on the Klamath River shelf is covered by clayey silts or silty clays that accumulate from the Klamath River suspended load. The outer shelf is covered by palimpsest silty sand. On the Eel River shelf, the mid- and outer- shelf is covered by clayey silts or silty clays that accumulate from the Eel River suspended load. On the shelf south of Eel Canyon, muds occur ponded between outcrops of underlying rocks.The clayey silts or silty clays began to accumulate during the Holocene transgression, approximately 10,000 to 12,000 BP. The base of this mud facies is time transgressive; the outer shelf portions began to accumulate prior to the mid-shelf portions.Below the mud facies, late-Quaternary units lie above an unconformity, separating the late-Quaternary units from pre-Quaternary units that make up the shelf platform. These late-Quaternary units crop out on the outer Klamath River shelf where they consist of palimpsest silty sands.The boundary between the Holocene mud facies and the nearshore sand facies is characterized by alternating layers of mud and silty sands. The alternations were produced by a migrating facies boundary due to changes in incoming waves. The facies boundary migrated between at least 46 and 71 meters waters depth during the Holocene.Flood-produced strata are preserved in the Holocene mud facies in the vicinity of the Eel River mouth. These flood-produced strata are composed of brown very fine sands and coarse silts, and contain layers of wood fragments. These flood-produced deposits are restricted to the shelf directly offshore of the Eel River mouth and slightly northward. These deposits were created during the December, 1964, flooding of the Eel River.\"" ;
