    dc:description "This data set is a part of Ecotrust's project entitled: Establishing a Baseline and Assessing Spatial and Socioeconomic Change in the California Central Coast Commercial and CPFV Fisheries. This project is a component of the California Central Coast Marine Protected Area Baseline Monitoring Project that is designed to characterize the ecological and socioeconomic conditions and changes within the Central Coast Region since MPA implementation. The Central Coast study region extends from the north at Pigeon Point to the south at Point Conception. These data depict the spatial change in the stated relative value of commercial fishing grounds difference for spatial fisheries data collected in the spring of 2012 (post-MPAs) and summer of 2005 (pre-MPAs). Specifically, the data were calculated by subtracting the post-MPA relative value surface data from the pre-MPA relative value surface data (x = pre-MPA - post-MPA). It is important to emphasize that only the relative value surface (also known as a 'heat map') that was developed for the pre and post MPA data sets were used in these analyses. In other words, ex-vessel revenue was not applied to the 'heat map' value surfaces, however ex-vessel revenue was used to weight and the aggregation of individual fishing grounds. This was done to reduce the number of variables which would influence analysis results. Thus, results are simply an examination of changes in the stated values/importance of fishing areas to a fishery?not spatial changes in revenue across the two datasets. The data ranges from negative to positive values on a relative scale. In this dataset the areas with negative values are areas where the post-MPA fishing values are greater than the pre-MPA values, thus an increase in relative importance and value between the 2005 survey to the 2012 survey. This dataset represents the spatial change in relative value for Nearshore finfish-live--trap commercial fishing grounds for the Central Coast Region." ;
