    dc:description "This data set maps and describes the geology of the Telegraph 7.5' quadrangle, San BernardinoCounty, California. Created using Environmental Systems Research Institute's ARC/INFOsoftware, the data base consists of the following items: (1) a double precision map coveragecontaining geologic contacts and units, (2) a coverage containing site-specific structuraldata, (3) a coverage containing geologic-unit label leaders and their associated attributetables for geologic units (polygons), contacts (arcs), and site-specific data (points). Inaddition, the data set includes the following graphic and text products: (1) A PostScriptgraphic plot-file containing the geologic map, topography, cultural data, a Correlation ofMap Units (CMU) diagram, a Description of Map Units (DMU), an index map, a regional geologicand structure map, and a key for point and line symbols; (2) PDF files of this Readme(including the metadata file as an appendix), Description of Map Units (DMU), and the graphicproduced by the PostScript plot file.The Telegraph Peak quadrangle is located in the eastern San Gabriel Mountains part of theTransverse Ranges Province of southern California. The generally east-striking structuralgrain characteristic of the crystalline rocks of much of the San Gabriel Mountains isapparent, but not well developed in the Telegraph Peak quadrangle. Here, the east-strikingstructural grain is somewhat masked by the northwest-striking grain associated with the SanAndreas Fault zone.Faults within the quadrangle include northwest-striking, right-lateral strike-slip faults ofthe San Andreas system. The active San Andreas Fault, located in the northern part of thequadrangle, dominates the younger structural elements. North of the San Andreas Fault is theinactive Cajon Valley Fault that was probably an early strand of the San Andreas system. Itwas active during deposition of the middle Miocene Cajon Valley Formation. South of the SanAndreas, the Punchbowl Fault, which is probably a long-abandoned segment of the San AndreasFault (Matti and Morton, 1993), has a sinuous trace apparently due to compression in theeastern San Gabriel Mountains that post-dates displacement on the fault. The Punchbowl Faultseparates two major subdivisions of the Mesozoic Pelona Schist and is left-laterally offset bya northeast-striking fault in the northwestern part of the quadrangle. Within the PunchbowlFault zone is a thin layer of highly deformed basement rock, which is clearly not part of thePelona Schist. To the southeast, in the Devore quadrangle, this included basement rockattains a thickness of several hundred feet. Along strike to the northwest, Tertiarysedimentary rocks are included within the fault zone. South of the Punchbowl Fault areseveral arcuate (in plan) faults that are part of an antiformal schuppen-like fault complex ofthe eastern San Gabriel Mountains. Most of these arcuate faults are reactivated and deformedolder faults, and probably include the eastern part of the San Gabriel Fault.The Vincent Thrust of late Cretaceous or early Tertiary age separates the Pelona Schist in thelower plate from a heterogeneous basement complex in the upper plate. Immediately above theVincent Thrust is a variable thickness of mylonitic rock generally interpreted as a productof displacement on the thrust. The upper plate includes two Paleozoic units, a schist andgneiss sequence and a schist, quartzite, and marble metasedimentary sequence. Both sequencesare thrust over the Mesozoic Pelona Schist along the Vincent Thrust, and intruded by Tertiary(late Oligocene) granitic rocks, granodiorite of Telegraph Peak, that also intrude the VincentThrust. The Pelona Schist consists mostly of greenschist to amphibolite metamorphic grademeta-basalt (greenschist and amphibolite) and meta-graywacke (siliceous and white micaschist), with minor impure quartzite and marble, in which all primary structures have beendestroyed and all layering transposed. Cretaceous granitic rocks, chiefly tonalite, intrudethe schist and gneiss sequence, but not the Pelona Schist or the Vincent Thrust.North of the San Andreas Fault, bedrock units consist of undifferentiated Cretaceous tonalite,here informally named tonalite of Circle Mountain, with some included small boldies of gneissand marble. These basement rocks are the westward continuation of rocks of the San BernardinoMountains and not rocks of the San Gabriel Mountains south of the San Andreas Fault. Alsonorth of the San Andreas Fault are the Oligocene Vaqueros Formation, middle Miocene CajonValley Formation, and Pliocene rocks of Phelan Peak. The latter two formations are dividedinto several conglomerate and arkosic sandstone subunits. In the northeastern corner of thequadrangle, the rocks of Phelan Peak are unconformably overlain by the Quaternary HaroldFormation and Shoemaker Gravel. Quaternary units ranging from early Pleistocene to recent aremapped, and represent alluvial fan, landslide, talus, and wash environments.The geologic map database contains original U.S. Geological Survey data generated by detailedfield observation and by interpretation of aerial photographs. This digital Open-File mapsupercedes an older analog Open-File map of the quadrangle, and includes extensive new data onthe Quaternary deposits, and revises some fault and bedrock distribution within the SanGabriel Mountains. The digital map was compiled on a base-stable cronoflex copy of theTelegraph 7.5' topographic base and then scribed. This scribe guide was used to make a 0.007mil blackline clear-film, from which lines and point were hand digitized. Lines, points, andpolygons were subsequently edited at the USGS using standard ARC/INFO commands. Digitizingand editing artifacts significant enough to display at a scale of 1:24,000 were corrected.Within the database, geologic contacts are represented as lines (arcs), geologic units aspolygons, and site-specific data as points. Polygon, arc, and point attribute tables (.pat,.aat, and .pat, respectively) uniquely identify each geologic datum." ;
