These new models are being developed by Duke University s Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab in partnership with NASA, the NOAA Cetacean & Sound Mapping project, and the U.S. Navy. The marine mammal data layers currently in MarineCadastre.gov represent habitat-based model estimates of animal density. The model results show estimates of the average number of animals per square kilometer during a given season. Most average estimates per square kilometer feature less than 1.0 animal because marine mammals are highly mobile and often occur in large groups. An average value of 0.5 bottlenose dolphins per square kilometer during the summer could mean a number of things. For example, it could mean that one animal would be present every other day; one group of five animals would be present once in a 10-day period; one group of 50 animals would be present every 100 days; and so forth.

    dc:description "The marine mammal and sea turtle layers in MarineCadastre.gov represent habitat-based density-model estimates of animal density. The marine mammal layers are a subset of a larger data set being delivered via the Cetacean and Sound Mapping website (http://cetsound.noaa.gov) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The model results show estimates of the average number of animals present per square kilometer during a given season. Most of the average estimates of animals per km2 are less than 1 because marine mammals are highly mobile and often occur in large groups. For example, an average value of 0.5 bottlenose dolphins per km2 during the summer could mean that 1 animal would be present every other day, or 1 group of 5 animals would be present once in a 10 day period, or 1 group of 50 animals would be present every 100 days, etc. These data originate largely from marine mammal observations generated through shipboard and aerial surveys conducted by NOAA s National Marine Fisheries Service. Models explicitly incorporate environmental factors whenever possible. The model outputs were generated through a collaborative effort that included NOAA, the U.S. Navy, and Duke University. User agreements, source reports, and additional resources can be found below under Additional Information." ;

    dc:description "The marine mammal and sea turtle layers in MarineCadastre.gov represent habitat-based density-model estimates of animal density. The marine mammal layers are a subset of a larger data set being delivered via the Cetacean and Sound Mapping website (http://cetsound.noaa.gov) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The model results show estimates of the average number of animals present per square kilometer during a given season. Most of the average estimates of animals per km2 are less than 1 because marine mammals are highly mobile and often occur in large groups. For example, an average value of 0.5 bottlenose dolphins per km2 during the summer could mean that 1 animal would be present every other day, or 1 group of 5 animals would be present once in a 10 day period, or 1 group of 50 animals would be present every 100 days, etc. These data originate largely from marine mammal observations generated through shipboard and aerial surveys conducted by NOAA s National Marine Fisheries Service. Models explicitly incorporate environmental factors whenever possible. The model outputs were generated through a collaborative effort that included NOAA, the U.S. Navy, and Duke University.

Most of the average estimates of animals per km2 are less than 1 because marine mammals are highly mobile and often occur in large groups. For example, an average value of 0.5 bottlenose dolphins per km2 during the summer could mean that 1 animal would be present every other day, or 1 group of 5 animals would be present once in a 10 day period, or 1 group of 50 animals would be present every 100 days, etc. These data originate largely from marine mammal observations generated through shipboard and aerial surveys conducted by NOAA s National Marine Fisheries Service. Models explicitly incorporate environmental factors whenever possible. The model outputs were generated through a collaborative effort that included NOAA, the U.S. Navy, and Duke University.

    dc:description "The marine mammal habitat-based density models for the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico currently featured in MarineCadastre.gov are outdated, and new models will be available online later in 2015. These new models are being developed by Duke University s Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab in partnership with NASA, the NOAA Cetacean & Sound Mapping project, and the U.S. Navy. The marine mammal data layers currently in MarineCadastre.gov represent habitat-based model estimates of animal density. The model results show estimates of the average number of animals per square kilometer during a given season. Most average estimates per square kilometer feature less than 1.0 animal because marine mammals are highly mobile and often occur in large groups. An average value of 0.5 bottlenose dolphins per square kilometer during the summer could mean a number of things. For example, it could mean that one animal would be present every other day; one group of five animals would be present once in a 10-day period; one group of 50 animals would be present every 100 days; and so forth.

    dc:description "The marine mammal and sea turtle layers in MarineCadastre.gov represent habitat-based density-model estimates of animal density. The marine mammal layers are a subset of a larger data set being delivered via the Cetacean and Sound Mapping website (http://cetsound.noaa.gov) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The model results show estimates of the average number of animals present per square kilometer during a given season. Most of the average estimates of animals per km2 are less than 1 because marine mammals are highly mobile and often occur in large groups. For example, an average value of 0.5 bottlenose dolphins per km2 during the summer could mean that 1 animal would be present every other day, or 1 group of 5 animals would be present once in a 10 day period, or 1 group of 50 animals would be present every 100 days, etc. These data originate largely from marine mammal observations generated through shipboard and aerial surveys conducted by NOAA s National Marine Fisheries Service. Models explicitly incorporate environmental factors whenever possible. The model outputs were generated through a collaborative effort that included NOAA, the U.S. Navy, and Duke University. User agreements, source reports, and additional resources can be found below under Additional Information." ;

The marine mammal layers are a subset of a larger data set being delivered via the Cetacean and Sound Mapping website (http://cetsound.noaa.gov) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The model results show estimates of the average number of animals present per square kilometer during a given season. Most of the average estimates of animals per km2 are less than 1 because marine mammals are highly mobile and often occur in large groups. For example, an average value of 0.5 bottlenose dolphins per km2 during the summer could mean that 1 animal would be present every other day, or 1 group of 5 animals would be present once in a 10 day period, or 1 group of 50 animals would be present every 100 days, etc. These data originate largely from marine mammal observations generated through shipboard and aerial surveys conducted by NOAA s National Marine Fisheries Service.

These new models are being developed by Duke University s Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab in partnership with NASA, the NOAA Cetacean & Sound Mapping project, and the U.S. Navy. The marine mammal data layers currently in MarineCadastre.gov represent habitat-based model estimates of animal density. The model results show estimates of the average number of animals per square kilometer during a given season. Most average estimates per square kilometer feature less than 1.0 animal because marine mammals are highly mobile and often occur in large groups. An average value of 0.5 bottlenose dolphins per square kilometer during the summer could mean a number of things. For example, it could mean that one animal would be present every other day; one group of five animals would be present once in a 10-day period; one group of 50 animals would be present every 100 days; and so forth.

    dc:description "The marine mammal and sea turtle layers in MarineCadastre.gov represent habitat-based density-model estimates of animal density. The marine mammal layers are a subset of a larger data set being delivered via the Cetacean and Sound Mapping website (http://cetsound.noaa.gov) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The model results show estimates of the average number of animals present per square kilometer during a given season. Most of the average estimates of animals per km2 are less than 1 because marine mammals are highly mobile and often occur in large groups. For example, an average value of 0.5 bottlenose dolphins per km2 during the summer could mean that 1 animal would be present every other day, or 1 group of 5 animals would be present once in a 10 day period, or 1 group of 50 animals would be present every 100 days, etc. These data originate largely from marine mammal observations generated through shipboard and aerial surveys conducted by NOAA s National Marine Fisheries Service. Models explicitly incorporate environmental factors whenever possible. The model outputs were generated through a collaborative effort that included NOAA, the U.S. Navy, and Duke University.

    dc:description "The marine mammal habitat-based density models for the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico currently featured in MarineCadastre.gov are outdated, and new models will be available online later in 2015. These new models are being developed by Duke University s Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab in partnership with NASA, the NOAA Cetacean & Sound Mapping project, and the U.S. Navy. The marine mammal data layers currently in MarineCadastre.gov represent habitat-based model estimates of animal density. The model results show estimates of the average number of animals per square kilometer during a given season. Most average estimates per square kilometer feature less than 1.0 animal because marine mammals are highly mobile and often occur in large groups. An average value of 0.5 bottlenose dolphins per square kilometer during the summer could mean a number of things. For example, it could mean that one animal would be present every other day; one group of five animals would be present once in a 10-day period; one group of 50 animals would be present every 100 days; and so forth.

    dc:description "The marine mammal and sea turtle layers in MarineCadastre.gov represent habitat-based density-model estimates of animal density. The marine mammal layers are a subset of a larger data set being delivered via the Cetacean and Sound Mapping website (http://cetsound.noaa.gov) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The model results show estimates of the average number of animals present per square kilometer during a given season. Most of the average estimates of animals per km2 are less than 1 because marine mammals are highly mobile and often occur in large groups. For example, an average value of 0.5 bottlenose dolphins per km2 during the summer could mean that 1 animal would be present every other day, or 1 group of 5 animals would be present once in a 10 day period, or 1 group of 50 animals would be present every 100 days, etc. These data originate largely from marine mammal observations generated through shipboard and aerial surveys conducted by NOAA s National Marine Fisheries Service. Models explicitly incorporate environmental factors whenever possible. The model outputs were generated through a collaborative effort that included NOAA, the U.S. Navy, and Duke University. User agreements, source reports, and additional resources can be found below under Additional Information." ;
