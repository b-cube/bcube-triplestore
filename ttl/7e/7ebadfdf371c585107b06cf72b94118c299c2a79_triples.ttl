    dc:description "This is the 1992 National Land Cover Data Set for Montana, projected to Montana State Plane Coordinates and converted to TIFF format. The National Land Cover Data Set was produced as part of a cooperative project between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to produce a consistent, land cover data layer for the conterminous U.S. based on 30-meter Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data. National Land Cover Data (NLCD) was developed from TM data acquired by the Multi-resoultion Land Characterization (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies that produce or use land cover data. Partners include the USGS (National Mapping, Biological Resources, and Water Resources Divisions), USEPA, the U.S. Forest Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Montana NLCD set was produced as part of a project area encompassing portions of Federal Regions 8 and 10. This data set was produced under the direction of the MRLC Regional Land Cover Characterization Project of the USGS EROS Data Center (EDC), Sioux Falls, SD. Questions about the data set can be directed to the MRLC Regional Team at (605) 594-6114 or mrlc@edcmail.cr.usgs.gov. This data set was extracted from the larger regional data set. State boundaries from the USGS 1:100,000 Digital Line Graph (DLG) series were used as the basis for extracting the state data. In many instances, the precision of the boundaries in the 1:100,000 DLG data does not match the spatial precision of the Landsat TM data. To overcome the possibility of data being lost in the extraction process, a 300 meter (10 pixel) buffer was added to the state boundary used to extract the state data. The base data set for this project was leaves-off Landsat TM data, nominal-1992 acquisitions. Other ancillary data layers included leaves-on TM, USGS 3-arc second Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) and derived slope, aspect and shaded relief, Bureau of the Census population and housing density data, USGS land use and land cover (LUDA), and National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) data if available. Caveats and Concerns: Both irrigated and dryland agriculture are practiced in this region. In the dryland areas small grains predominate; fields are classified as fallow when there is no evidence of visible vegetation indicating a prescribed alternation between cropping and tillage. Crop types in the irrigated areas were difficult to reliably distinguish; row crops are likely to be under represented where no field observations or other ancillary information was incorporated." ;
