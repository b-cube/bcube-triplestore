    dc:description "Land surface forms for the conterminous United States were also generated as part of the ecosystems modeling effort (Cress and others, 2009b). After extensive investigation into various land surface form methodologies, the decision was made to use the methodology developed by the Missouri Resource Assessment Partnership (MoRAP). MoRAP made modifications to Hammond's (1964a, 1964b) land surface form classification, which allowed the use of 30-meter source data and a 1-km2 window for analyzing the data cell and its surrounding cells (neighborhood analysis) (True, 2002; True and others, 2000). While Hammond's methodology was based on three topographic variables, slope, local relief, and profile type, MoRAP's methodology uses only slope and local relief (True, 2002). Using the MoRAP method, slope is classified as gently sloping when more than 50 percent of the area in a 1-km2 neighborhood has slope less than 8 percent, otherwise the area is not gently sloping, that is, steeply sloped. Local relief, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum elevation in a neighborhood, is classified into five groups: 0-15 m, 15-30 m, 30-90 m, 90-150 m, and >150 m. The land surface form classes are derived by combining slope and local relief which creates eight landform classes: flat plains (gently sloping and local relief <= 15 m), smooth plains (gently sloping and 15 m < local relief <= 30 m), irregular plains (gently sloping and 30 m < local relief <= 90 m), escarpments (gently sloping and local relief > 90 m), low hills (not gently sloping and local relief <= 30 m), hills (not gently sloping and 30 m < local relief <= 90 m), breaks/foothills (not gently sloping and 90 m < local relief <= 150 m), and low mountains (not gently sloping and local relief > 150 m). However, in the USGS application of the MoRAP methodology, an additional local relief group was used (> 400 m). As a result, low mountains were redefined as not gently sloping and 150 m < local relief < 400 m, and a new land surface from class, high mountains/deep canyons, was identified as not gently sloping and local relief > 400 m. The final application of the MoRAP methodology was preformed using the USGS 30-meter National Elevation Dataset (NED), and an existing USGS slope dataset that had been derived by calculating the slope from the NED in Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates in each UTM zone, and then combining all of the zones into a national dataset. As a final step, an additional class called drainage channels was derived independently from the other land surface form classes and was used to identify wet and dry river channels, which were not specifically represented by any of the other classifications. This class was based on the two Andrew Weiss's slope position classes that represented areas positioned lower than the surrounding areas, valley and lower slope (Weiss, 2001; Jenness, 2006). The USGS applied Weiss's algorithm to the 30-meter NED data using a 1-km2 neighborhood analysis window and then the resultant drainage channel class was added to the land surface forms dataset. Thus, the final land surface forms dataset contains ten classes: flat plains, smooth plains, irregular plains, escarpments, low hills, hills, breaks/foothills, low mountains, high mountains/deep canyons, and drainage channels." ;
