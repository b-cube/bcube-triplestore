    dc:description "The Clark Fork, Plains Reach Channel Migration Zone analysis was conducted in 2014. The project covers 8.0 miles of the Clark Fork from Henry Creek to Lynch Creek around the town of Plains in western Montana. The project was sponsored by the Montana DNRC Renewable Resource Planning Grant Program, Sanders County, and the Middle Clark Fork River Plains Reach Recovery Committee. The work was performed by the Bozeman office of RESPEC Consulting and Services. The Channel Migration Zone analysis for the Plains Reach includes an assessment of the Historical Migration Zone, the development of an Erosion Buffer, identification of Avulsion Potential Areas, and incorporation of Restricted Migration Areas. For the Plains Reach, the Historical Migration Zone was delineated by digitizing the active channel margin in 1995, 2005, and 2013 in GIS using aerial imagery. The active channel includes both the mainstem and side channels, along with exposed gravel bars. In addition, historical aerial imagery was used to estimate the outer extent of the channel margin between 1955 and 1995. The Erosion Buffer was developed for a 100 year planning period using retreat rates measured within the Plains Reach between 1995 and 2013. Avulsion Potential Areas were delineated based on overflow channels and floodplain swales identified using a 3-Meter DEM from 1999 and on-the-ground observations. The Restricted Migration Area was delineated along riprap, levees, roads and railroads, which were identified through an analysis of aerial imagery and on-the-ground observations. This geodatabase contains the historic migration zone, channel migration zone buffer, and avulsion potential areas that were designated by the study. It also contains the man-made riprap and levee lines and geological valley control features that limit channel migration. The positions of the active stream channel, gravel bars, and islands digitized from aerial photographs of 1995, 2005, and 2013 are included. The CMZ is an estimate of the area in which future channel migration might occur and can be used for planning development and land management activities within the identified area. The CMZ is not intended to be used for regulatory purposes. The data are distributed with the \"Clark Fork River Plains Reach Assessment and Restoration Prioritization\" report that describes the processes used to create the data." ;
