    dc:description "This assessment was undertaken to examine the current status of, and make strategic recommendations concerning, the mining and minerals industry cluster in Arizona. It has been coordinated with a parallel study being undertaken in Sonora by Guillermo Salas, Victor Calles, and Hector Hinojosa. The assessment includes: metallic nonfuel minerals; industrial minerals; and energy resources, including uranium, coal, oil and natural gas. It also reviews the current infrastructure that exists in Arizona, which is necessary for economic development of mineral and energy resources. The purpose of this report is to present an overview of the geographic, geologic, and operational status of the currently-developed mineral and energy resources in the State of Arizona, and to refer the reader to additional sources of information for greater detail on specific resources. This report consists of a narrative description of background information on the minerals and energy industry of Arizona including the existing infrastructural-institutional factors that affect those industries. The infrastructure subsection explains the transportation (highway and railroad) and utility (electricity, natural gas, and water) networks in the State. It also contains general information on milling, smelting, and refining facilities as well as permitting and taxation procedures and policies with respect to mineral development in Arizona." ;
