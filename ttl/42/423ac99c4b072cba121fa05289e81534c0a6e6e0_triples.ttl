    dc:description "The TIGERweb application allows users to access and view geospatial features, geographic area information, and associated attributes from the U.S. Census Bureau Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing System (TIGER) geodatabase. The TIGERweb Decennial application is intended to meet the needs of users inside and outside the Census Bureau for access to geospatial data contained within the TIGER geodatabase without requiring the use of a GIS. The TIGERweb map layers are grouped by the following geographies: Transportation (Roads and Railroads), PUMAs, UGAs, and ZCTAs Tribal Census Tracts and Block Groups, Census Tracts and Blocks Military and other Special Land Use Areas School Districts Places and County Subdivisions American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Areas, Legislative Areas Census Regions and Divisions, Urban Areas Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas and Related Statistical Areas Hydrography States and Counties Labels are included for the map layers. These layers contains the latest version of legally defined areas reported to the Census Bureau and reflect the governmental units in effect as of January 1, 2014 or legal or statistical boundaries that have adjusted or corrected since the 2010 Census. Physical features like hydrography, transprtation and special land use areas like military reservations reflect updates as of September 2014. In addition to the January 1, 2014 vintage (BAS 2015, ACS 2014), the TIGERweb application also contains data as of January 1, 2013 (ACS 2013) and data as of January 1, 2010 (2010 Census). This application contains two vintages of data. The 2010 Census consists of data as of January 1, 2010. The Census 2000 vintage consists of data as of January 1,2000 that has been adjusted and/or corrected since Census 2000." ;
