    dc:description "This database contains information collected during the 2002-2008 Northwestern Hawaiian Islands cooperative lobster tagging cruises. Funding for this research was provided by NOAA National Cooperative Research Program. The purpose of the cruises was to utilize the catch and tag/recapture information to estimate life history information and population dynamics (growth, mortality, size structure) on the appropriate spatial scale necessary for accurate stock assessments. From 2002-2007 two ex-lobster commercial fishing vessels were contracted to conduct lobster trapping operations. In 2008, funding limitations allowed the hire of only one vessel. Scientists aboard the vessels identified each lobster captured, recorded the sex and carapace length, and fitted each spiny lobster (Panulirus marginatus) and scaly lobster (Scyllarides squammosus) with a tag. In 2002, operations only took place at Necker Island and only spiny lobsters were tagged. In 2003, operations took place at Necker Island (only spiny lobsters were tagged) and at Maro Reef (only slipper lobsters were tagged). In 2006 thru 2008 both species were tagged at Necker Island, Gardner Pinnacles, Maro Reef, and Laysan Island. Ribbon tags were initially used (2002) but because of poor retention rates, passive integrated transponder tags (PIT tags) were used to tag both species from 2003-2008. Because the fishery closed in 2000 the tagging cruises were the only means for recaptures." ;
