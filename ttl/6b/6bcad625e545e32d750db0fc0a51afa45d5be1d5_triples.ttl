    dc:description "The Southern Ocean Fine structure (SOFine) dataset comprises hydrographic (temperature, salinity, current velocities, microstructure and turbulence), bathymetric and meteorological (air temperature, pressure, winds, humidity and irradiance) measurements from the Kerguelen Plateau region of the Southern Ocean. The data were collected between late 2008 and early 2010 via one research cruise (November - December 2008) and two long-term mooring deployments (November 2008 - January 2010). Data collection involved the deployment of a conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) package accompanied by lowered acoustic Doppler current profilers (LADCPs) at numerous locations across the study area. Microstructure was measured using a freefall Vertical Microstructure Profiler (VMP) and opportunistic measurements of upper ocean turbulence were collected with a tethered ISW Wassermesstechnik microstructure profiler. The station data were supplemented by continuous underway measurements of current velocities (using a vessel mounted ADCP, VMADCP); bathymetry (using single- and multi-beam echosounders); and surface ocean and meteorological parameters. Floats and drifters were also deployed, as were five moorings: three were recovered approximately 2.5 weeks later during the cruise and two were deployed for more than one year. The moored instruments measured physical parameters such as temperature, conductivity and pressure, horizontal and vertical current velocities (using moored ADCPs) and turbulence (using moored microstructure profilers, MMPs). The SOFine project aimed to enhance our understanding of frictional processes that slow the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and help to drive the Southern Ocean overturning circulation. SOFine involved researchers from UK, US, Australian and German institutions, including the National Oceanography Centre (NOC), the University of East Anglia (UEA), British Antarctic Survey (BAS), Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the University of Tasmania and the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences (IFM-GEOMAR), University of Kiel. The UK principal investigator (PI) is A. Naveira Garabato from the School of Ocean and Earth Science, NOC and the majority of the data are managed by the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC). The float and drifter data are managed by the Argo programme and Australian research institutions, and are not held at BODC." ;
