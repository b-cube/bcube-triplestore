    dc:description "This point datalayer shows the locations of colleges and universities in Massachusetts. Sites appearing in this layer are those normally attended by students after completion of high school. Categories are public and private, and include co-ed, vocational, technical, religious, medical. and traditional colleges and universities. This layer was developed by MassGIS and is based on all Massachusetts colleges listed in the National Center for Education Statistics website (http://www.nces.gov) as of October 13, 2004. A very small number of colleges could not be contacted and had no website, and therefore have been eliminated from this datalayer. A few institutions have multiple campuses, as distinct from satellite locations. For example, Harvard School of Business and Harvarrd Medical School are campuses within Harvard University, and a point is included in this dataset for each. Some satellite campuses may not be included. For example, Northeastern University conducts classes in satellite locations such as Milford High School. Since Milford High School is a separate educational facility, it is not considered to be a Northeastern University campus, and a point is not included in this layer. The layer is stored in ArcSDE and distributed as COLLEGES_PT. For pre-kindergarten through high school educational facilities, see the SCHOOL_PT layer." ;
