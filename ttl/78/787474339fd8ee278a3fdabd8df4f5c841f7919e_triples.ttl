    dc:description "\"An intermediate basin between coastal and offshore depressions of the California Continental Borderland, Santa Cruz Basin, with a general depth of 1900 m, lies south of the Channel Islands. Steep walls, with a thin sediment cover, abut against the flat basin floor. Hummocky topography, related to slumping, marks the northwestern quadrant of the basin floor. Three major canyon systems provide paths for sediments from the northern and southern insular platforms, while buried channels mark the previous existence of a fourth system. The western wall is relatively straight and featureless when compared to the structural terraces, volcanic knolls, and other irregularities of the eastern slope. Hydrographic data indicate that the surface and near surface water circulation is affected by wind stress and the association of the Southern California eddy with the California current. Offshore transport of surface water by both the prevailing northwesterly and easterly (\"Santa Ana\") winds causes upward water movement, apparently at all depths, which is aided by low stability at and below the basin sill. Most subsurface water movement is toward the north and northwest with considerable variation in speed and direction. A tidal cycle is also shown by the data. Surficial mixing is caused by the combined effects of currents, upwelling, intrabasin seiches, and internal waves. Heatflow and sediment transport are suggested as possible factors in addition to seiches and upwelling to cause overturn of deep basin water. The complex pattern of sedimentation found in the basin is a reflection of oceanographic, physiographic and sedimentologic conditions and geologic history. Partial infilling comes from either end of the basin in the form of turbidite sedimentation. The resulting sedimentary structures reflect both a proximal and distal sedimentation regime. Turbidite and hemipelagic sedimentation is disrupted by bioturbation. This burrowing action of organisms is abundant but patchy, often disrupting structures to the extent of making them almost indiscernible. The hemipelagic sediments found in this basin are organically rich, olive gray clay-silts. The recent stratigraphic history of Santa Cruz Basin is marked by a decreased Holocene rate of \"turbidite\" sedimentation while the hemipelagic contribution has increased slightly. Carbonate production over the basin as reflected in foraminiferal abundances and total carbonate production has varied greatly, being greatest about 7,000 yr B.P. Correlation using carbonate abundance as a stratigraphic tool reflects a sedimentation trend controlled by topography. Rates of accumulation on the basin floor are greatest (30 mg/cm2/yr) in the deepest portions and become less (9 mg/cm2/yr) as the walls are approached. The changes in production are most probably reflecting changes in productivity of waters overlying the basin. Changes in the circulation pattern are due to the rise and fall of sea level and the resultant topographic effects on oceanography.\"" ;
