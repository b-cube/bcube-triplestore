    dc:description "Commercial shipping activity can lead to ship strikes of large animals, noise pollution, and a risk of ship groundings or sinkings. Ships from many countries voluntarily participate in collecting meteorological data globally, and therefore also 7 report the location of the ship. We used data collected from 12 months beginning October 2004 (collected as part of the World Meteorological Organization Voluntary Observing Ships Scheme; http://www.vos.noaa.gov/vos_scheme.shtml) as this year had the most ships with vetted protocols and so provides the most representative estimate of global ship locations. The data include unique identifier codes for ships (mobile or a single datum) and stationary buoys and oil platforms (multiple data at a fixed location); we removed all stationary and single point ship data, leaving 1,189,127 mobile ship data points from a total of 3,374 commercial and research vessels, representing roughly 11% of the 30,851 merchant ships >1000 gross tonnage at sea in 2005 (S14). We then connected all mobile ship data to create ship tracks, under the assumption that ships travel in straight lines (a reasonable assumption since ships minimize travel distance in an effort to minimize fuel costs). Finally, we removed any tracks that crossed land (e.g. a single ship that records its location in the Atlantic and the Pacific would have a track connected across North America), buffered the remaining 799,853 line segments to be 1 km wide to account for the width of shipping lanes, summed all buffered line segments to account for overlapping ship tracks, and converted summed ship tracks to raster data. This produced 1 km2 raster cells with values ranging from 0 to 1,158, the maximum number of ship tracks recorded in a single 1 km2 cell. Because the VOS program is voluntary, much commercial shipping traffic is not captured by these data. Therefore our estimates of the impact of shipping are biased (in an unknown way) to locations and types of ships engaged in the program. In particular, high traffic locations may be strongly underestimated, although the relative impact on these areas versus low-traffic areas appears to be well-captured by the available data (Fig. S2), and areas identified as without shipping may actually have low levels of ship traffic. Furthermore, because ships report their location with varying distance between signals, ship tracks are estimates of the actual shipping route taken. Invasive Species (ports) The incidence of invasive species was modeled as a function of the amount of cargo traffic at a port, on the basis of results from other studies showing a relationship between these two variables (S15, 16) and in the absence of actual data for the global 8 distribution of invasive species. Port volume data (in metric tons, mt) were available for 618 global ports from several sources: the 2002 World Port Ranking (N=36) and 2003 U.S. Port Ranking (N=102) compiled by the American Association of Port Authorities (http://www.aapa-ports.org), Australia ports database (N=30; http://www.aapma.org.au/tradestats; access date 3/19/05), and Lloyds List database [N=450; Ref (S17)]. These data are for different years between 1999 and 2003. For 81 ports, multi-year data were available. These multi-year data were used to calculate annual percent change in port volume. Average annual percent change was then calculated for large ports (>50 million mt of cargo, N=18) and smaller ports (<50 million mt of cargo, N=63). These values were used to adjust port volume data for the 618 ports to produce estimated 2003 volumes with values ranging from 11,729 - 350,573,176mt (mean = 3,364,552mt). The World Port Index (http://www.nga.mil/portal/site/maritime/) lists 4,606 global ports, with details of the types of services available at the port, such as port depth, number of cranes available, train access, etc. The port locations were initially reported to the nearest tenth degree of latitude and longitude; we geocoded the port names with Geonames (http://gnswww.nga.mil/geonames/GNS) to accurately assign port location at the 1 km2 resolution. The number of services at each port was summed, giving a range of values for each port from 0 to 44. Port volume data from the 618 ports with volume data were regressed against these values and an exponential function (best fit) was fit to the data [P<0.0001, R2=0.27]. This relationship was then used to calculate port volume data for the other ~4000 ports. Although this relationship has relatively low explanatory power, it allows for a reasonable estimate of port volume in areas where actual data are not available. Port volume values were input into a model of spread, described below, that was used to calculate a relative measure of risk of invasive species. To model the spatial impact of invasive species, we used a diffusive plume model to mimic invasion fronts and spread the value for each port at 1 km2 resolution into adjacent waters, with a minimum threshold value of 5 mt set as a limit to the spread of the plume (i.e., once the value in a cell fell below 5 mt, the plume was assumed to be at its furthest extent). This set a maximum distance from the largest port of 1000 km, an arbitrary but reasonable maximum distance. These areas were then clipped to the shallow 9 habitats (<60 m depth), since most known invasive species transported by ballast water are intertidal or shallow subtidal. Our approach to modeling invasive species does not account for species that arrive through other transport mechanisms (such as aquaculture), and it assumes a linear relationship between invasive species occurrence and port volume, and between spatial extent of the invasion and port volume. The former relationship may instead have a threshold value or non-linear relationship, but such relationships are probably taxa-specific and are not currently known for most species. The latter relationship is also not likely to be linear, as the spread of species along coastlines is more likely a function of time since introduction and dispersal capabilities, variables which are available for only a select few marine invasive species, and the relative ocean climatology of the origin and destination of the ship. For example, models that account for the environmental niche of potential invaders perform better than models created solely on the basis of port volume (S18), but such niches are not known for most invasive species, and tracking the origin and destination of ships is computationally prohibitive." ;
