    dc:description "The Hood River, Oregon Salmon Production Program is co-managed by the Warm Springs Tribe (WS) and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) for supplementing spring Chinook salmon in the Hood River system. The current Master Plan for the Hood River Production Program (March 5, 2008 draft) calls for a comparative hatchery release study designed to provide co-managers with the best available information for determining a long term, biologically sound, and cost effective spring Chinook salmon production strategy for the Hood River Basin that balances harvest needs with ecological considerations. Rearing facilities, both inside and outside the basin, are being evaluated for long-term use in the Hood River spring Chinook supplementation program. The objective is to conduct a multi-year (2008-2018) comparative study of Hood River spring Chinook reared at three different hatchery facilities prior to being moved to the West Fork Hood River for final acclimation and release. The facilities include Round Butte Hatchery/Pelton Ladder (RBH) on the Deschutes River, OR; Columbia Gorge Hatchery (CGH), a.k.a. Carson Hatchery on the Wind River, WA; and Parkdale Fish Facility (PFF) on the Hood River, OR. There is currently limited large-scale fish rearing capacity at PFF, and all juvenile rearing for the Hood River program is currently conducted out of basin at RBH. The CGH hatchery provides another potential out-of-basin (but more geographically localized) large-scale rearing facility for this program. Each year, starting fall 2008, returning adults will be collected in the Hood River, artificially spawned at the PFF, and gametes will be distributed to each of the respective hatchery facilities for long term-rearing to the parr-smolt stage. Starting in spring 2010, uniquely tagged juveniles from each facility will be moved to the Moving Falls Acclimation Pond on the West Fork Hood River for acclimation and forced release in April. The Hood River Master Plan calls for monitoring fish health, size at release, specific growth rates, rates of precocious male maturation (age-2 minijacks, age-3 jacks), and ultimately smolt-to-adult returns (SARs) for each brood year/release group. SARs for all adult year classes from all brood years will be available starting in 2013 with final returns in 2018. These data will be used to evaluate which hatchery facility/regime is optimum for future long-term implementation in the Hood River Supplementation program. Hood River Steelhead Trout Residualism Monitoring Hatchery-reared steelhead may adopt one of three life history pathways after release: 1. Smolt and migrate to sea 2) Sexually mature and remain in freshwater and attempt to spawn naturally (primarily males), or 3) \"Residualize\" as a non-smolting and non-maturing parr, and delay migration or maturation 'decisions' until the subsequent year(s). Starting in FY 2012, we will initiate a study using physiological indices to quantify residualism rates of the steelhead trout population supplemented in to the Hood River by WS and ODFW. These fish are from Hood River natural origin brood stock reared at Oak Springs Hatchery on the Deschutes River, OR and released in to the Hood River in May of each spring. Prior to transfer of the fish from Oak Springs to the Hood River, we will collect 300 fish, and sample them for length, weight, condition factor, body lipid, pituitary glands for measurement of mRNA levels of reproductive hormones, plasma for measurement of 11-ketotestosterone and gonad tissue for mRNA measurement of reproductive hormones and histological analysis. Gill tissue was collected for determination of Na+/K+-ATPase enzyme activity as an indicator of smoltification. These data will be used to help determine rates of residualism in Hood River steelhead, and to potentially help modify rearing regimes for these fish to minimize residualism rates. Length, weight, condition factor, whole body lipid, plasma IGF-1 and 11-Ketotestosterone, gill ATPase activity" ;
