    dc:description "Most of Seward Peninsula is underlain by rocks that were part of a Late Proterozoic to early Paleozoic continental margin; remnants of that margin are also present in the Brooks Range. The extensive high-pressure metamorphic rocks exposed in central Seward Peninsula (Nome Complex), the southern Brooks Range, and the Ruby geanticline are thought to record subduction of that continental margin during the Jurassic. Rolling, tundra-covered hills cover most of the Seward Peninsula; trees and shrubs are present only in limited areas in the southern and eastern parts of the Peninsula. An extensive, unvegetated lava field occupies a central area and large areas in northernmost and easternmost Seward Peninsula. The York Mountains of western Seward Peninsula and hills adjacent to them on the east are underlain by bare, unvegetated carbonate rocks. Four glacially carved mountain ranges, the York, Kigluaik, Bendeleben, and Darby Mountains, reach heights of 1,000-1,300 m. Broad lowlands underlie large areas in central and northern Seward Peninsula. This geologic map is a compilation of published and unpublished geologic mapping and information derived from other published and unpublished sources. Published geologic maps at scales of 1:250,000, 1:63,360, and 1:50,000 were major sources and range in publication date from 1972 to 2005. More detailed studies, including theses, papers, and unpublished mapping, represent work done between 1980 and 2008. This data set is a portion of a statewide geology database, which is being compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey's National Surveys and Analysis (NSA) project, whose goal is to compile geologic, geochemical, geophysical, and other data." ;
