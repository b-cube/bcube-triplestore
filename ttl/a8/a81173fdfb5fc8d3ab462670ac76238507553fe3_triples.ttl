    dc:description "Visual transect surveys were performed and hogfish (Lachnolaimus maximus) were harvested over a range of depths and habitat types within the central eastern Gulf of Mexico. Hogfish were recorded as present during 73% of all performed dives, and were most common over rugose natural hard bottom habitat. As depth and distance from shore increased, hogfish density decreased; however, mean hogfish size and age showed a positive relationship with depth. A dramatic difference emerged between shallow and deep water collections, with fish transitioning into males at a much smaller size and age within shallow water. Furthermore, fish older than 8 yrs and larger than 559 mm FL were not recorded from shallow water sites, while deep water collections yielded fish as old as 19 and as large as 765 mm FL. Observed sex ratio had a mean value of 1:10 M: F, and showed no change with season or site depth, suggesting that hogfish maintain harem structure throughout the year. Gonad histology and visual observations of courtship behavior support previous accounts that hogfish spawn in the winter and spring, with highest reproductive activity recorded during March and April. Evidence is presented for a more protracted spawning period at greater depths. Growth parameters as well as survival and mortality estimates are similar to those estimated previously for hogfish within the eastern Gulf of Mexico." ;
