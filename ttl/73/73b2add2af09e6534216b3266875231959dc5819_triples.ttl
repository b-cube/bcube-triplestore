    dc:description "Bathymetry for Yaquina Bay was derived from two surveys containing 9,279soundings. Two older, less accurate, overlapping surveys were removed beforetinning. The average separation between soundings was 39 meters. Both surveysused dated from 1953. The total range of soundings was 1.2 meters to -13.1meters at mean low water. Mean high water values of 1.8 and 1.9 meters wereassigned to the shoreline. Three points were found that were not consistent withthe surrounding data. These were removed prior to tinning. DEM grid values outside the shoreline (on land) wereassigned null values (-32676).Yaquina Bay has three 7.5 minute DEMs and two one degree DEMs. The 1degree DEMs were generated from the higher resolution 7.5 minute DEMswhich covered the estuary. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) contains aseries of elevations ordered from south to north with the order ofthe columns from west to east. The DEM is formatted as one ASCIIheader record (A- record), followed by a series of profile records(B- records) each of which include a short B-record header followedby a series of ASCII integer elevations (typically in units of 1centimeter) per each profile. The last physical record of the DEM isan accuracy record (C-record).The 7.5-minute DEM (30- by 30-m data spacing) is cast on theUniversal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. It provides coveragein 7.5- by 7.5-minute blocks. Each product provides the samecoverage as a standard USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle but the DEMcontains over edge data. Coverage is available for many estuaries ofthe contiguous United States but is not complete." ;
