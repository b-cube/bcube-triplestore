    dc:description "Members of the Fishery Resource Analysis and Monitoring Division Survey Team conduct an annual West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey from May - October each year, then verify and enter all catch information into an existing database. From 1977 to 1998, the bottom trawl groundfish surveys were conducted triennially; since then, they have been conducted annually, and have been extended to include depths from 55 m N) to the U.S.-Mexico border (3230N). The groundfish fishery includes about 90 commercially fished stocks off Washington, Oregon, and California. The survey provides data on abundance, spatial distributions, sex, length, maturity, weight, and age structure of groundfish in trawlable habitats. These surveys are a key source of fishery-independent data necessary to support stock assessments of managed groundfish species inhabiting trawlable habitat along the U.S. West Coast's upper continental slope and shelf. The time series of survey estimates of abundance and age are used in age-structured assessment models for important management species. All survey operations are conducted within strict compliance with NOAA protocols for bottom trawl surveys. Catch and related information are quality checked at sea. The goal is to ensure the sustainability of marine fisheries with a focus on ending overfishing. The survey area is covered twice by chartered commercial fishing vessels (20 to 28 m length). The data are also central to the status and trends time series presented in the California Current Integrated Ecosystem Assessment, and also remain the primary data source for the Atlantis modeling used in several of Management Testing analyses. This survey is mandated by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Re-authorization Act of 2006. This data set contains information on date, time, vessel, trawl identification (i.e. unique number), trawl performance, location, depth, area swept, trawl duration, temperature, species, haul weight, average individual weight, sex, length, length method, fish age and age structure" ;
