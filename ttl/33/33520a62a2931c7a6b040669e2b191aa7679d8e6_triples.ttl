    dc:description "A series of pitfall traps were established along the riparian corridor of the lower eight-mile reach of Big Beaver Creek, North Cascades National Park Complex (NOCA), Washington, during the summers of 1995 and 1996. Arthropods are known to represent at least 85% of the biological diversity of all flora and fauna found in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in western Oregon. One might expect similar diversity in NOCA. Twelve families of Hemiptera:Heteroptera are reported here from the 1995 and 1996 seasons. Twenty-four genera were recognized representing thirty-two species. Two families, the Miridae and Scutelleridae were mentioned but not treated as were the other species because the specimens of Miridae were in bad condition from the pitfall traps (they are very fragile) and the Scutelleridae (Eurygaster sp.) lacked adequate data. Most of the species were typical inhabitants of the riparian zone (e.g. the Anthocoridae, Lygaeidae, Nabidae, and Saldidae) whereas others in or on the water (e.g. Belostomatidae and Gerridae). A few species were surprises - Aradus orbiculus Van Duzee, a strongly brachypterous specimen, rare, and usually found under bark. Ceratocombus vagans (McAtee and Malloch) is one of the most primitive living Hemiptera:Heteroptera. It is very small (under 2mm) and is a predator in the litter layer in moist habitats. It is a widespread, chiefly boreal species. Stygnocoris sabulosus (Schilling) was the only non-indigenous bug species recovered from the study. It is a well-known European species known to feed on seeds. Barce fraterna banksii (Baker) is a wingless pirate bug and is a predator as are many of the species collected. The two species of Acalypta - A. lillianis (Torre-Bueno) and A. mera (Drake) are very typical moss inhabitants in Northwest forests, especially in clearings or open stands. More collecting indifferent locations and habitats will enhance our knowledge and add rapidly to our general knowledge base for NOCA. Much of interest lies ahead of us." ;
