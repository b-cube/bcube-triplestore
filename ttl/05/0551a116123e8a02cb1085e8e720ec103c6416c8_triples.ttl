    dc:description "Ants represent a functionally important group of arthropods. They are central to many ecosystem processes and are actively involved in decomposition of dead wood, nutrient cycling, plant pollination, seed dispersal, and predation on other arthropods. They also provide are also prey for many wildlife species and other arthropods. The assessment of their status can provide much information useful in monitoring the integrity of biotic communities. Ant communities of nine riparian habitat types within the Big Beaver Creek Research Natural Area (BBCRNA) were sampled with pitfall traps, for five months, in 1995. A subset of five of the habitats was resampled with pitfall traps, for four months, during 1996. A total effort of 17,880 trap-days yielded 2,772 individuals, representing 22 species of ants. Ant species richness in the BBCRNA study area compared to species richness for other areas in Western Canada and the Pacific Northwest. Results indicated that there was very little difference in abundance and number of taxa collected among most the habitat types. Most habitats, with the exception of gravel bars, exhibited relatively low species richness and low abundance. Gravel bar habitats were represented by 13 of the 22 taxa collected during the study, and approximately 45% of all ant specimens collected. Most of the ant species collected in the BBCRNA study area were considered rare and / or vagrant, being collected in low abundance at few sample sites. Seven species, of the 22 taxa collected during the study, comprised over 90% of all individuals captured in each of the years sampled. Four species were considered as habitat generalists, and two species as habitat specialists - Formica pacifica and Myrmica nr. brevispinosa. Both of these species were found almost entirely at gravel bar habitat sites. Indicator values (Dufrene and Legendre 1997) associated with these two habitat specialist species were expectedly high, offering the potential for use in future habitat monitoring." ;
