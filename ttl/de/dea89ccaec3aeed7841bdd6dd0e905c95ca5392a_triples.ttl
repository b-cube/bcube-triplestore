    dc:description "Connecticut 305b Assessed River 2008 is a 1:24,000-scale, line feature-based layer that includes rivers that have been assessed to comply with Sections 305(b) and 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act. Section 305(b) of the Clean Water Act requires each state to monitor, assess and report on the quality of its waters relative to attainment of designated uses established by the State's water quality standards. Section 303(d) requires each State to compile a subset of that list identifying only those waters not meeting water quality standards and assign a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) priority ranking to each impaired waterbody. This layer is based on information collected and compiled prior to 2008. It represents conditions at a particular point in time and does not represent current conditions. This layer includes only rivers that were assessed in the time period above referenced. It can be used with the 2008 Connecticut 305b Assessed Lake layer and the Connecticut 305b Assessed Estuary layer to geographically display attainment and non-attainment for each designated use on assessed waters within Connecticut's boundaries. Features are lines that represent the locations of assessed rivers. The sources for these features include the hydrography layer and the water quality classification layer. Attribute information is comprised of a unique identifier (segment ID) for each feature, the name of the waterbody, its location, the assessment cycle (year), the water type, the water quality class goal, the length of the feature in miles, the National Hydrography Dataset basin number, and the assessment for the following categories: aquatic life, recreation, fish consumption, and drinking water supply. Data is compiled at 1:24,000 scale. This dataset is not updated. For more information, please refer to the following report: \"2008 State of Connecticut Integrated Water Quality Report\" at http://www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/water/water_quality_management/305b/2008_final_ct_integratedwqr.pdf" ;
