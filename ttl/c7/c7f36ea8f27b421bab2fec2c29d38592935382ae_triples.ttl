    dc:description "The Office of the National Geodetic Survey has produced a series of high-resolution gravimetric geoid models, hybrid geoid models, and associated deflection of the vertical products for the United States. The gravimetric geoid models are referred to the Geodetic Reference System of 1980 (GRS80), situated in the most recent IGS reference frame . The hybrid geoid models and associated deflection of the vertical models refer to the NAD 83 datum, and are used as a transformation between NAD 83 and NAVD 88. Major geoid products were released in 1990, 1993, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2012. Each release represents an improvement in accuracy over the previous models but, more specifically, represents an improved tie to the spatial reference information existing on bench marks archived in the NGS database at the time they were generated. Hence, NAD 83 and NAVD 88 coordinate information collected and processed in 2003 are consistent with the GEOID03 model. Whereas recently collected data are more consistent with GEOID12A. The newest (2012) products are (1) USGG2012, a gravimetric geoid model, (2) GEOID12A, a hybrid geoid model. A GEOID12 model existed briefly but was replaced with GEOID12A when defects were found in control data used to determine GEOID12. These were fixed and a GEOID12A model released. USGG2012 converts between IGS08 (2005.0) and a geopotential surface built upon the underlying EGM2008 (separate product developed by NGA) reference geoid height model for all regions (conterminous US (CONUS), Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands, Guam & the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), and American Samoa). GEOID12A converts between NAD 83 (2011.0) and NAVD 88 for CONUS and Alaska only, between NAD 83 (PA11) and the local vertical datums in Hawaii, and American Samoa, and NAD 83 (MA11) and the local vertical datums in Guam and CNMI. Within CONUS, most users should use GEOID12A. It is constructed specifically to relate GPS ellipsoid heights in the NAD 83 datum (epoch 2011.0) and orthometric heights in the NAVD 88 datum including those in the Gulf Coast Subsidence Regions where Vertical Time Dependent Positioning is employed to determine NAVD 88 heights. These are the datums used in many maps and charts, and most applications require that consistency. GEOID12A also exists for Alaska to provide a transformation between NAD 83 and NAVD 88 - where it is available. NAVD 88 coverage in Alaska is not complete and may not be suitable for all regions. For some scientific applications, use of USGG2012 is appropriate (for water flow and height transfer). However, NAVD 88 remains the official vertical datum approved for use in charting and surveying. No NAVD 88 coverage exists in Hawaii, so GEOID12A converts between the same geopotential surface determined for USGG2012 and NAD 83 (PA11).Guam, CNMI, American Samoa, Puerto Rico (PR), and the U.S. Virgin Islands (VI) all have their own separate vertical datums distinct from NAVD 88. GEOID12A converts between the appropriate local version of NAD 83 and the respective vertical datums for each of these regions. The GEOID12A product comprises eight files for the conterminous US, four files for Alaska, and one each for Hawaii, PR/VI, American Samoa, and Guam/CNMI. Single grids also are available for CONUS and Alaska. Each file contains geoid heights on a one minute by one minute grid in both big-endian and little-endian binary (PC compatible) formats. The INTG program is supplied at the download site to interpolate to a specific position within these grids. Another program, XNTG, is supplied to extract subsets and convert the grids between ASCII and binary. Both are in FORTRAN, are available compiled and as source code, and can byte-swap the grids if needed on a Unix platform. There is also an on-line geoid computational facility within the NGS Geodetic Tool Kit at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS. Similar files, programs, and on-line computational facilities exist for USGG2012, USDOV2012 and DEFLEC12A99. USDOV2012 and DEFLEC12A are Deflection of the Vertical models that describe the angular difference between the normal (plumblines) to the ellipsoid and vertical datum. USDOV2012 was determined from USGG2012, while DEFLEC12A was determined from GEOID12A. Hence, USDOV2012 is in IGS08 (2005.0 ), and DEFLEC12A is in NAD 83 (2011/PA11/MA11). See the GEOID section of the NGS Web site at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/GEOID. Geoid and deflection of the vertical models for Mexico and the Caribbean were computed in 1997 and are distributed as MEXICO97, DMEX97, CARIB97, and DCAR97 respectively. Note, however, these models are largely superseded by the GGM10 model developed by INEGI in Mexico. All geoid products covered here are considered valid inside the U.S. and its territories only. Geoid height values, especially for GEOID12A, are valid within national boundaries. Canada and Mexico are sovereign nations with their own national height systems. For other areas outside of the above models or other national interests, the EGM2008 model exists as a highly accurate global reference model. NGS also offers technical information concerning the construction of the geoid models and practical information concerning its use on the NGS web site at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/GEOID. NGS also offers a workshop concerning GPS derived heights and the use of the geoid models to convert from GPS derived heights to orthometric heights (see http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PC_PROD/WorkShops/)." ;
