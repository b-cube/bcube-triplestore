    dc:description "The North Inlet Estuary and the adjacent lower northeastern section of Winyah Bay Estuary were designated as part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve System in 1992. The North Inlet - Winyah Bay (NIW) NERRs environmental monitoring program began running under the auspice of the NERR program in June 1993. In 1995, the NERR program began a System-Wide Monitoring Program that set protocols for monitoring the estuarine environment. Collection protocols for weather data were not developed until 1997, and the NIW sites data collection procedures changed from the previous 15 years to follow these new guidelines. The NIW meteorological data were collected on a 15-minute, hourly and 24-hour basis beginning July 2, 1997, in North Inlet Estuary, Georgetown County, SC. Readings were taken 24 hours a day, every day of the year, except when individual probes or the entire meteorological station were down. The station includes sensors for air temperature, relative humidity, photosynthetically active solar radiation (LiCor sensor), barometric pressure, wind speed, wind direction, solar radiation (Eppley sensor), and rain. All sensors were scanned every 5 seconds to generate 15-minute totals for rain and LiCor solar radiation, and hourly and 24-hour averages for all other parameters. Fifteen-minute instantaneous readings were also collected for all parameters except rain and LiCor. Only the 15-minute data for 1997 through 1999 are available. All LiCor data were removed because they were found to be incorrect (See Supplemental Information and Anomalous Data Sections)." ;
