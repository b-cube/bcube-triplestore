    dc:description "The objective of this project is to develop a simple approach for estimating the carrying capacity of nearshore and offshore marine habitats to support juvenile Chinook salmon during their initial marine life stage. This study focuses on subyearling Chinook salmon in the Puget Sound region of Washington state during their residence in Puget Sound. Krista Bartz was the principal investigator for this project, with guidance from collaborators, but has left the agency: * Correigh Greene, Casey Rice, and Kurt Fresh (Northwest Fisheries Science Center, NWFSC) * Dave Beauchamp and Liz Duffy (University of Washington, UW) * Eric Beamer (Skagit System Co-Operative) * Mary Ruckelshaus (Natural Capital Project) Specific work to be completed involves honing techniques for validating the capacity estimates, and completing a manuscript describing the work. Specific product to be produced is a peer-reviewed manuscript. Audience for the project was initially intended to be NWFSC staff involved in parameterizing a Puget Sound-wide life-cycle model for Chinook salmon. Since ~2008, when that effort stalled, there has been a resurgence in interest in developing such a model. This is a one-time, stand-alone project with a soft deadline of December 2014. Meeting the deadline depends on finding staff to accomplish the work. Data is modeled data on carrying capacity which is generated from several existing field data sets- see Worksites." ;
