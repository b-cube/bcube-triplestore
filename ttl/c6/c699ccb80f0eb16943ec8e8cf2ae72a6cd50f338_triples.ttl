    dc:description "This ArcSDE feature dataset contains roads in Illinois as derived from US Geological Survey 1:100,000-scale Digital Line Graph files, transportation layer, 1980-1986. This includes all the DLG roads data that ISGS/IDNR customarily stored by county-by-county prior to 2004. The dataset is subdivided into four feature classes: interstates and defense highways, U.S. highways, Illinois state routes, and \"all roads\", which includes the three previous classes plus most local roads as of 1986. Note that the functional classification of roadways is the jurisdiction of the Illinois Department of Transportation and is subject to change. For more current road information, including downloadable GIS data, refer to the Illinois Department of Transportation Technology Transfer Center (IDOT T2 Center) at http://dot.state.il.us/blr/t2center1.html. This metadata document describes the SDE feature dataset as a whole and contains information that applies to all the feature classes. Each feature class has an additional unique metadata file describing its specifics. Publication dates of the USGS maps used as sources range from 1980 to 1986. Major highways were updated as of 1993. The maximum estimated error in horizontal position based on National Map Accuracy Standards is 167 feet. Experience shows that actual locational error appears to be greater, especially in localized areas. Rough comparison of these data with other easily obtainable, low-cost roads data shows that locational accuracy varies from locale to locale. Other datasets have better accuracy in some areas and worse in others. Overall, the general quality of most low-cost roads data appears to be the same, with local variation. Attributes include road class, road type, DLG code, route numbers, and data source, among others. The All_Roads feature class is the parent of the other three feature classes and contains all attribute information. The Interstate, State_Routes, and US_Highways feature classes are subsets of All_Roads and contain only route numbers. The data are stored in geographic coordinates, NAD83. These data have not been updated since 1993, nor are there current plans to do so. With the exception of major highways, the data have not been updated since 1986. Accordingly, these data are for general reference and cartographic use. This is a legacy dataset made available as a convenience. The data are not suitable for showing all local roads at a large scale for any given area. These data can be considered to be essentially out of date and unmaintained. These data and most of the accompanying metadata were originally developed and maintained by staff of the Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS), an agency of the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR), under the auspices of the Illinois Geographic Information System (IGIS) initiative (circa 1986). Maintenance of the metadata was transferred to ISGS circa 1996." ;
