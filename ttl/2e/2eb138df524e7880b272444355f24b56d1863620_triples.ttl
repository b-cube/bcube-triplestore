    dc:description "A group of eight tidal creeks dominated by oysters, Crassostrea virginica, in North Inlet, South Carolina, USA were studied using a replicated BACI (Before - After Control - Incident) design in which all creeks are sampled simultaneously. Before the pre-manipulation year, oyster biomass in each creek was manipulated so that all eight creeks had an equal oyster biomass to water volume ratio of 8 grams dry body weight of oysters per cubic meter. Detailed geomorphological observations were made on each creek as the study began. Nutrients and chlorophyll a were measured weekly in each creek and exhibited seasonal and inter-annual influences. Phytoplankton pigment levels were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Intensive planktonic - microbial loop and nekton samplings were conducted seasonally. Oyster growth was measured monthly. In the second or manipulation year, the role of oysters was tested by removing them from four creeks. Planktonic abundance and dispersal of the oyster parasite, Perkinsus marinus, nekton abundance and biomass, oyster biomass, growth and survival, changes in water chemistry, and phytoplankton pigment levels were also investigated in the tidal creeks during this manipulation year." ;
