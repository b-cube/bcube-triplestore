    dc:description "Between March 2001 and January 2002, available Hawaii pelagic longline vessel owners and/or operators were interviewed at Kewalo Basin and Honolulu Harbor to obtain cost and revenue information to support a cost-earnings analysis of this fleet. Any permitted Hawaii longline vessel that fished in 2000 and was in port during the interview period was approached. Survey questions focused on variable costs (costs incurred when the vessel actively fished) and fixed costs (costs incurred regardless of the number of trips the vessel took) as well as vessel characteristics, demographics, fishermen's comments, and the economic effects of recent management changes because of protected species issues. Operational and vessel costs were collected by personal interview with vessel owners, captains and crew. Revenue information was obtained from the Hawaii Department of Aquatic Resources commercial catch reports. In additon, commercial fishing industry members were also interviewed and provided pertinent ancillary information on the longline fleet. J. M. O'Malley and S.G. Pooley conducted this data collection." ;
