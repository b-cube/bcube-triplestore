    dc:description "\" The strata formed on continental margins record the history of both marine and terrestrial events occurring on Earth. The STRATAFORM Program was created to develop a better understanding of relationships between these events and margin stratigraphy. In order to obtain the maximum information from strata, they are being examined simultaneously on various temporal and spatial scales, and their formation is being studied where events and accumulation are known to be active. The general objectives of STRATAFORM are: to add geological perspective to studies of sedimentary processes, to constrain stratigraphic interpretations better, and to develop numerical models relating processes and stratigraphy. This research is being undertaken on margins off northern California and New Jersey, which provide unique opportunities for investigation of short-term and long-term stratigraphy, respectively. This volume and paper focus upon studies undertaken off northern California, north of Cape Mendocino. This area is tectonically active, with a coastal mountain range, narrow shelf, and input of sediment primarily from the Eel River. Recent estimates indicate that 1 to 3 107 t/yr of mud (silt and clay) are supplied to the continental shelf. Sand accumulates on the inner shelf (<55 m water depth), and the mud rapidly deposits on the middle shelf north of the Eel mouth. An energetic physical regime causes significant seaward transport of muddy sediment, and much (>70%) reaches the continental slope (or deeper). During the previous lowstand of sea level, sediment discharge was ~25% greater, and probably led to hyperpycnal, debris and other flows transporting sediment down the slope. On the Eel shelf, flood and storm events combine to create normally stratified fine-grained layers with basal sand, and much terrestrial organic debris. These layers are modified through time, but some can be buried and preserved. Subsurface flood layers seem to impact observations of acoustic backscatter on the middle shelf, and subsurface fluids (gas? freshwater?) affect electromagnetic measurements on the inner shelf. Budgets of Eel River mud accumulation for the past century indicate ~20% trapped on the adjacent shelf and ~20% on the upper slope (150-600 m). The remaining 60% is dispersed to more distal locations. Over Holocene time scales, Eel River sediment has built a small sandy subaqueous delta, and a subtle bulge of muddy sediment on the middle shelf north of the river. Gullies have been eroded on the open slope during lowstands of sea level, and have accreted upward during highstands. A massive failure has formed the Humboldt slide, due to earthquake activity and unstable substrates (possibly from excess pore pressures and gas). The tectonic setting has impacted margin stratigraphy from small scales (fluid-expulsion pockmarks) to large scales (spatial variation of late Cenozoic sedimentation). The broad dispersal of Eel sediment demonstrates the three-dimensional character of the resulting stratigraphy, including the large-scale clinoform structure developed on the shelf/upper slope. The rollover point (topset/foreset boundary) for this feature is the shelf break (i.e., below sea level), which is important information for stratigraphic interpretations of sea-level change. \"" ;
