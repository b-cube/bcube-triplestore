    dc:description "Extended flow testing at the Fenton Hill Hot Dry Rock (HDR) test facility concluded in Fiscal Year 1993 with the completion of Phase 2 of the long-term flow test (LTFT) program. As is reported in detail in this report, the second phase of the LTFT, although only 55 days in duration, confirmed in every way the encouraging test results of the 112-day Phase 1 LTFT carried out in Fiscal Year 1992. Interim flow testing was conducted early in FY 1993 during the period between the two LTFT segments. In addition, two brief tests involving operation of the reservoir on a cyclic schedule were run at the end of the Phase 2 LTFT. These interim and cyclic tests provided an opportunity to conduct evaluations and field demonstrations of several reservoir engineering concepts that can now be applied to significantly increase the productivity of HDR systems. The Fenton Hill HDR test facility was shut down and brought into standby status during the last part of FY 1993. Unfortunately, the world's largest, deepest, and most productive HDR reservoir has gone essentially unused since that time. The injection pump problems which led to the suspension of the LTFT in July 1992 were resolved this year. Early in the year, two different diesel driven, reciprocating pumps were used for interim flow testing while a suitable replacement pump capable of extended operation under the standard LTFT operating conditions was sought. A centrifugal pump rented from REDA of Bartlesville, OK, proved to be well-suited to the job. The REDA pump was an electrically powered, multistage unit assembled specifically for the Fenton Hill application. It arrived at the HDR site in late January 1993. A number of modifications to the site electric supply system were required to bring the REDA pump on-line, but once these were completed it operated with 100% reliability until it was returned to REDA upon expiration of the lease in late May. Although the centrifugal REDA pump lacked the operational versatility of the reciprocating pumps used in earlier HDR testing, its low initial cost and high reliability would no doubt make it the pump of choice for injection under the well-defined, steady-state operating conditions that would probably be typical of a commercial HDR power plant. The transfer of HDR technology was promoted in Fiscal Year 1993 through a series of organized conferences as well as in a large number of meetings and communications with individual companies. Near the end of the fiscal year, the USDOE published a Notice of Pro gram Interest soliciting input on participation in a project involving the marketing of energy derived from HDR resources. By early 1994, it was apparent that there was significant private sector interest in the practical application of HDR technology. 1" ;
