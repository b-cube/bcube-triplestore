    dc:description "This data set is an LAS format file containing LIDAR point cloud data with 3998194 points. The data set was generated from a larger data set and includes all valid points within the requested geographic bounds.The Columbia River Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) survey project was a collaborative effort to develop detailed high densityLiDAR terrain data for the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The LiDAR will be used to support hydraulic modeling work associatedwith proposed 2014 Columbia River treaty negotiations. The dataset encompasses approximately 2836 square miles of territory in portionsof Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana within the Columbia River drainage. This survey was under the jurisdiction of three Corpsdistricts: Portland (CENWP), Seattle (CENWS), and Walla Walla (CENWW). CENWP was the project lead and primary contracting organization.Bare earth point data are classified as either ground (2), model key point (8) or water (9) and represent the earth's surface with allvegetation and human-made structures removed. Model key points were generated to represent the bare earth surface within a 0.07 m tolerance.Ground points (class 2) are the remaining ground points not classed as model key. Both ground and model key classes are needed for display ofall bare earth points. Water classification was used for those bare earth/ground classified points that fell inside a water boundary asdetermined using softcopy photogrammetry with stereograms generated from LiDAR intensities. All remaining points received the defaultclassification (1). In some areas of heavy vegetation or forest cover, there may be relatively few ground points in the LiDAR data.The RMSE of the data for open, hard-packed surfaces is 0.046 meters as assessed from 40,266 ground survey (real time kinematic) points takenon hard-packed road surfaces. This value is representative of anticipated accuracies in open, evenly sloped or flat terrain where maximum pointdensities were achieved.The project was completed for the US Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District, to support hydraulic modeling related to the ACOE ColumbiaRiver Treaty project. Data acquisition, bare earth processing, and development of final tiled LiDAR deliverables and DEM's was performed byWatershed Sciences, Inc. Overall project management, photogrammetric quality control review using LiDAR stereograms, water delineation andbreakline development was performed by David C. Smith & Associates, Inc. Professional Surveyor oversight of ground control data, groundcontrol data processing and ground control publication was performed by David Evans and Associates, Inc. Final quality control review inArcGIS of all final deliverables, including preparation of point density rasters and reach based geo-databases incorporating all deliverables,was performed by CC Patterson and Associates.NOTE ON DATUM ISSUES: All ground control and subsequent LiDAR data deliverables were developed and delivered at NAD '83 CORS 96 horizontaland NAVD '88 Geoid '09 vertical datums as processed in OPUS-DB. Due to limitations in the transformations supported by ESRI, NAD '83 andNAVD '88 datums were temporarily assigned to the ESRI deliverables and ESRI .prj file even though the actual coordinate values in the datafiles are at the original NAD '83 CORS 96 and NAVD '88 Geoid '09 datums. In many instances, a temporary assignment of NAD '83 HARN or HPGNmay better approximate local conditions. Plain NAD '83 was used for the primary deliverable in order to avoid any implication of higherprecision; however, the user may want to evaluate other approximations for specific applications. At such time as ESRI includes supportfor NAD '83 CORS '96, the temporary NAD '83 assignment in the .prj file should be replaced with NAD '83 CORS '96 without further reprojection.The NOAA Coastal Services Center has converted the data to ellipsoid heights (using Geoid09) and NAD 83 geographic coordinates for data storageand Digital Coast provisioning purposes." ;
