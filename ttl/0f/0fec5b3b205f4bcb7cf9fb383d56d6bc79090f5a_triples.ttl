NOTE: An updated data set named WATERWELLS_DNR_WATER_IN_120312.SHP was provided to Indiana Geological Survey personnel on March 15, 2012, by Mr. Michael P. Martin, GIS Coordinator, Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Division of Outdoor Recreation. NOTE: An updated data set named WATERWELLS_DNR_WATER_IN_130530.SHP was provided to Indiana Geological Survey personnel on July 23, 2013, by Mr. Michael P. Martin, GIS Coordinator, Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Division of Outdoor Recreation. The following is excerpted from the metadata provided by IDNR for the source shapefile WATERWELLS_DNR_WATER_IN_130530.SHP: \"This file is a digital geospatial point feature class of both located water well records (which include UTM coordinates) and unlocated water well records (without UTM coordinates as of 200911). The estimated locations used for the unlocated wells were based on the polygon centroid values for the smallest indicated section, quarter, quarter-quarter, or quarter-quarter-quarter section (as indicated in the database) for over 250,000 water well records and for about 26,000 of the 250,000 water well records the UTM's were obtained from address geocoding using the owners address, a generally more accurate method (see process steps below).\"" ;
