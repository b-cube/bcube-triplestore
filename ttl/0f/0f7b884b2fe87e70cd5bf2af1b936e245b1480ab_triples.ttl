    dc:description "The California Flood Management Districts geodatabase contains several spatial data layers indicating boundaries of various local flood management agencies throughout the state. There are also attribute tables indicating current contact information, updated as of Spring, 2006, as included in the Directory of Flood Officials, produced by the California Department of Water Resources Division of Flood Management. Of the various layers, the most numerous are referred to as reclamation districts. The reclamation districts layer is an indication of the approximate jurisdictional boundary of both currently active or once-active-but-now-inactive reclamation districts. Districts have in some cases merged, dissolved, divided, and been modified since their original formation. The reclamation districts indicated here were generated from a variety of sources, including (in order of boundary accuracy preference) complete legal descriptions submitted at the time of District formation, CAD boundary files provided by District engineers, boundaries digitized by Department of Water Resources Delta-Suisun Office over orthophotography, incomplete legal descriptions submitted at the time of District formation, DWR Land Use maps, a 1997 California Office of Emergency Services effort to map boundaries, and sundry other means. The work has essentially been an ongoing effort since the production of the original 1997 layer, in order to improve that first effort somewhat. Most of the improvements have focused on Districts within the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region, since DWR's office responsible for that area has undertaken most of the improvement work. As a result, there are probably many remaining data gaps and inaccuracies, particularly in areas outside of the Delta. This is particularly true of DWR maintenance areas and for levee districts, both of which will certainly require updating in the future." ;
