    dc:description "This raster represents development change agents (CAs) in the Central Basin and Range Ecoregion. In the scenario-based assessment of conservation elements (CEs), this raster has been developed to represent CAs in a clear, combined format and to answer the management questions (MQs) such as, where do CAs intersect CEs? The raster contains 20 classes which represent different types of human infrastructure on the landscape. This raster represents development change agents (CAs) in the Central Basin and Range Ecoregion for the near-term future scenario (year 2025). In the scenario-based assessment of conservation elements (CEs), this raster has been developed to represent CAs in a clear, combined format and to answer the management questions (MQs) such as, where do CAs intersect CEs? The raster contains 20 classes which represent different types of human infrastructure on the landscape. Some types are easily defined, precise footprints (pipelines, roads, energy development areas) while others are broader land cover types derived from spatial models (development, mining and refuse areas). This scenario has all of the same inputs as the Current Scenario Development CA Assessment raster but has four layers that depict planned or modeled infrastructure expected to be on the landscape in the near term future. These layers include an urban growth forecast for the year 2030, the Section 368 transmission corridors (West-wide Energy Corridor Programmatic EIS) and renewable energy projects on federal land that have begun the environmental permitting process with BLM (but are not approved). While these models and projects are considered likely to occur, they are not definite or approved by any federal, state or local agency. For additional information on these layers please see the section on attribute information. During the construction of the layer, we observed that many CAs will overlap and per agreement by the AMT, where overlapping CAs were detected these were reclassified as “multiple CAs.” All input data was rasterized to 30m cells. Exceptions include raster input data which includes Crops/Irrigate Pastures, Military Urbanized Areas which were derived at 30m from the NLCD 2006. Urban/Rural Development was also raster data modeled to 90m resolution. The final assessment raster was maintained at 30m, despite this input limitation. Due to computational limitations, any assessment products derived from this may be transformed to 90m. This data was visually inspected against input data sets to assure that the thematic and geographical integrity of the inputs were maintained." ;
