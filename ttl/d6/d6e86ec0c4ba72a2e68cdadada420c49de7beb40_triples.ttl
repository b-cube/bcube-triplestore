    dc:description "As a member of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Council on the Ocean (MARCO), Virginia, through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program, collected information on how the public uses the Atlantic coast of Virginia through a two day particpatory GIS workshop in July of 2012. These baseline data were collected to inform planning efforts being undertaken by Virginia CZM to help develop a Virginia Ocean Plan, to help Virginia CZM and the Accomack-Northampton Planning District Commission (A-NPDC) to continue development of the Seaside Special Area Management Plan, and to be incorporated into a regional recreational ocean use dataset that will eventually be displayed on the MARCO data portal. Collecting data on the variety of ways the public uses the Seaside Bays and Atlantic Ocean will help to plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. State and federally managed waters of Virginia and the U.S. are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, shipping, military exercises, sand mining, habitat for wildlife, and recreation. With new and expanding coastal and ocean uses emerging such as energy production and increased shipping and considering Virginias coastal population is increasing (from 3.6 million in 1986 to 5.1 million in 2010), the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data existed, but prior to this project, Virginia had no recreational water use data for its Atlantic coast and Seaside Eastern Shore Bays. This data was colected using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Marine Protected Areas (MPA) Center Participatory Mapping Method: http://marineprotectedareas.noaa.gov/dataanalysis/mapping_ocean_uses/welcome.htmlThis data is available to view on the Virginia CZM Program's online mapping portal, Coastal GEMS, at www.coastalgems.org" ;
