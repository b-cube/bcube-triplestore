    dc:description "On December 16-17, 1974 a workshop on \"Future Developments in Waste Heat Utilization\" was held at Portland, Oregon under the direction of Oregon State University and sponsored by the Energy-Related General Research Office, Research Directorate, National Science Foundation. During the last few years, numerous research projects aimed at finding beneficial uses for waste heat have been initiated. There was a need to: Summarize current activities in a meeting where all concerned organizations and disciplines are represented. Exchange information on current programs. Obtain the views of the power generating industry. Obtain the views of potential users of waste heat. Make recommendations for future research and development. This workshop was an attempt to respond to these needs. Sixty-two researchers in the field of waste water utilization participated in the workshop. This constituted a national representation from universities, industries and government agencies. This report summarizes the results of the intensive two -day discussion. The program was divided into three discussion areas. Since most waste heat is associated with warm water discharged from power generation plants the initial discussion related to power plant operations and waste heat utilization. Following this, the scope of on-going research programs was presented by those investigators active in the projects. Following these presentations, there was open discussion during the last half day of the workshop. This brought out comments both for and against waste heat utilization and resulted in suggestions for future research and novel applications. Each participant was asked to provide a short summary, before leaving the conference, describing what he believed to be the greatest need in waste heat utilization research. These comments as well as results of the open discussions are summarized in Part 4 of the report under the title \"Specific Applications.\"" ;
