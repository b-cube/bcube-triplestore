    dc:description "Scientists from the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC), United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Pacific Biological Station (PBS), Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), Canada, collaborate for the biennial Integrated Acoustic and Trawl (IAT) Survey on Pacific Hake (Merluccius productus) off the West Coast of the United States and Canada. As newer vessels were preparing to come online, an Inter-Vessel Calibration (IVC) project was initiated in 2008 and continued in 2010. The primary goal of the IVC was to determine if there were differences in acoustic measurements between the various vessels used during IAT Survey. The IVC is a crucial component of continuing the long-term time series of IAT surveys, one that allows for the direct comparison of data that were collected historically to data collected on newer vessels. Acoustic data was collected, as well as trawl operations, similar to methods used in the IAT Survey. Analysis of the collected data is ongoing. Data collected from trawl activities: in 2008, the Miller Freeman, Oscar Dyson, and the WE Ricker were used; in 2010, the Bell Shimada and the Miller Freeman." ;
