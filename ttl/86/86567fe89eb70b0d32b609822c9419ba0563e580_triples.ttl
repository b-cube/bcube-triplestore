    dc:description "Director Lee Allison's Report ~ In Fiscal Year 2014, the Arizona Geological Survey (AZGS) maintained its core functions in addressing natural hazards and natural resources in Arizona, and not only cemented our role as a national leader in geoinformatics or geoscience cyberinfrastructure but expanded our impact globally as well. AZGS geologists responded to natural hazards including debris flows and landslides following wild fires, the magnitude 5.3 Duncan Arizona earthquake, and a plethora of new or expanded earth fissures resulting from monsoon downpours. The deadly landslides in Washington and Colorado this past year prompted us to reallocate a modest amount of internal funds to start a statewide inventory of known landslides, something never before undertaken. A full inventory, characterization, and assessment will be a multi-year effort, assuming we can continue to support the work. We made substantial progress in getting the hundreds of thousands of pages of reports and files gathered by the former Arizona Department of Mines & Mineral Resources digitized, georeferenced, and online at the interactive Arizona Geological Survey Mining data website. Our Phoenix operations moved out of temporary space to co-locate with the Arizona Department of Water Resources, with much better public access and enhanced ability to collaborate between our agencies. One of the highlights of the year was the formal launch of the National Geothermal Data System (NGDS) by U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz at the White House Energy Datapalooza, in Washington, DC in May 2014. NGDS went operational as a federated data network with over 10 million data records covering 30 different types of data, from 60+ contributing data providers in all 50 states. AZGS has managed this Department of Energy project since 2010 on behalf of the Association of American State Geologists. NGDS is the largest application of the US Geoscience Information Network (USGIN). We spun off USGIN Foundation, Inc. as a non-profit company to commercialize the services and turn NGDS into a sustainable operation. The USGIN data framework meets all the requirements of the White House Open Data Access Initiative, and has wide applicability to other resources beyond geothermal, including petroleum, minerals, and water, and natural hazards. The Arizona Natural Resources Review Council adopted USGIN as the basis of a Natural Resources Decision Support System linking data, documents, and maps among the nine state environment, resource, and transportation agencies, to better enable the State of Arizona to respond effectively to the thousands of federal agency land use and land management proposals made every year. The AZGS took on a major project for the National Science Foundation (NSF) to design and test a community-led governing structure for geoscience cyberinfrastructure under the EarthCube program. It is a dramatic departure from how scientific organizations are set up, and is intended to build community consensus on a system architecture, a challenge the community has struggled with for 15 years. Following on the heels of early EarthCube successes, NSF asked AZGS to lead the US Secretariat for the Belmont Forum e-Infrastructure and Data Management project in partnership with colleagues from the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. I serve as co-chair of the project s international Steering Committee with representatives from 13 nations science funding agencies, the European Union, International Council for Science, and International Social Science Council. We have an 18-month process, with 120 experts in science, technology, legal and security issues from the participating countries, to produce a strategic plan for enabling global change research. The AZGS growing national and global presence is paying dividends on multiple levels. The digital technologies we are developing are being put to work on the State s Natural Resources Decision Support System, at our new portal for digital mines and mineral resources, and at the interactive, online Natural Hazards in Arizona viewer. This is critical since AZGS funding continues to be dominated by external grants. The State appropriation for AZGS is less than 10% of our total budget, as it has been for several years. The grants we bring in help support basic operations of the agency so that we continue to maintain all the services to Arizona that we provided prior to the recession and the substantial cuts that all agencies took. In summary, AZGS helped save lives and property from natural hazards, supported the wise development of our natural resources, is making Arizona a global leader in cyber technology, and has become an entrepreneurial center of economic development. This report provides more details on these activities and perspectives from the geologists and others on staff who are carrying out the work. M. Lee Allison State Geologist & Director" ;
