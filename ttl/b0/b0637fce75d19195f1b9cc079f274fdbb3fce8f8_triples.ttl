    dc:description "The Antarctic Deep Water Rates of Export (ANDREX) dataset comprises hydrographic and biogeochemical data. Measurments include temperature; salinity; currents; concentrations of geochemical tracers such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), freon, tritium, radiocarbon and noble gases; alkalinity; dissolved oxygen and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2); and nutrient concentrations (nitrate, silicate and phosphate). These data are supplemented by meteorological (air pressure, air temperature, wind velocity, relative humidity, radiation) and bathymetric measurements. The data were collected along a track running from the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula to 30 deg E that corresponds to the northern limb of the Weddell gyre within the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Data collection was undertaken in December 2008-January 2009 and March-April 2010 over two UK research cruises. In 2008 the section was aborted approximately halfway due to a medical evacuation. The track was completed during the second cruise in March-April 2010. Data were collected via the deployment of conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) profilers, accompanied by lowered acoustic Doppler current profilers (LADCPs), at numerous stations along the cruise track. This permitted the collection of water samples for biogeochemical analyses. In addition to measurements at individual stations, various parameters were measured continuously throughout each cruise, including current velocities (using a vessel mounted ADCP, VMADCP), water depth and surface ocean and meteorological properties. These data will be supplemented by measurements collected on a US CLIVAR section (a WOCE I6S repeat) between South Africa and Antarctica along 30deg E in January-February 2008. The ANDREX project aims to enhance our understanding of the role of the Weddell gyre in the meridional overturning circulation, in ventilating the deep ocean and in sequestering carbon and nutrients in the global deep ocean. ANDREX is a joint effort between UK, German and US research institutes, including the National Oceanography Centre (UK), the University of East Anglia (UK), British Antarctic Survey (UK), the University of Manchester (UK), Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (USA) and the Alfred Wegener Institute (Germany). The UK principal investigator (PI) is A. Naveira Garabato from the School of Ocean and Earth Science, NOC. Data collected during the UK cruises will be managed by the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) but those collected on the US CLIVAR section will not be held at BODC." ;
