    dc:description "A group of eight tidal creeks dominated by oysters, Crassostrea virginica, in North Inlet Estuary, South Carolina, USA were studied using a replicated BACI (Before - After Control - Incident) design in which all creeks are sampled simultaneously. The study known as the CREEK Project began in January 1996. Based on detailed geomorphological observations from North Inlet creeks, by fall of 1996, eight small intertidal creeks had been selected based on similarities in size and configuration. Nutrients and chlorophyll a were measured weekly in each creek and exhibited seasonal and inter-annual influences. Triplicate 1000-ml (one Liter) water samples were collected weekly from March 1997 to February 2000 at a depth of 1.0 meter below the water's surface three hours after high tide from each of the eight experimental creeks. Water temperature was recorded at the time of collection; time was recorded in DST. The water samples were analyzed for chlorophyll a, nitrogen [total nitrogen filtered (TNF), ammonia (NH4), and nitrate (NO3)], phosphorus [total phosphorus filtered (TPF), and orthophosphate (PO4)], organic carbon [dissolved (DOC)], and suspended sediment [Total Suspended Sediment (SusSol), Organic Suspended Sediment (OSS), Inorganic Suspended Sediment (ISS)]. Salinity was measured when the samples were brought into the laboratory for processing." ;
