    dc:description "This project is a collaboration between the NWFSC, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. Two trawl gear modifications for reducing fish bycatch (weight) in ocean shrimp trawls were tested in 2010. The primary focus of the study was evaluating trawl system modifications for reducing bycatch of eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus) below levels already achieved via mandatory use of bycatch reduction devices (BRDs). An experimental footrope, modified by removing the central one third of the trawl groundline, reduced eulachon bycatch by 33.9%. It also reduced bycatch of slender sole (Lyopsetta exilis), other small flatfishes, and juvenile darkblotched rockfish (Sebastes crameri) by 80% or more, but had no effect on bycatch of whitebait smelt (Allosmerus elongatus) or Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii). The experimental groundline also reduced the catch of shrimp (weight) by 23.2%. Reducing bar spacing in a rigid-grate BRD from 25.4 mm to 19.1 mm reduced eulachon bycatch by 16.6%, with no reduction in shrimp catch. It also reduced bycatch of slender sole, other small flatfish and juvenile darkblotched rockfish by 36.8%, 71.8% and 76.3%, respectively, with no effect on bycatch of whitebait smelt or young-of-the-year (YOY) Pacific hake (Merluccius productus). A second aspect of this project tested footrope modifications designed to reduce the bycatch megafaunal invertebrates, and reduce physical impacts on benthic communities in the ocean shrimp trawl fishery.
