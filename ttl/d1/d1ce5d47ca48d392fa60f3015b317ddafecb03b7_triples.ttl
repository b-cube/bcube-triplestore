    dc:description "A group of eight intertidal creeks with high densities of oysters, Crassostrea virginica, in North Inlet Estuary, South Carolina, USA were studied using a replicated BACI (Before - After Control - Incident) design in which all creeks are sampled simultaneously. The study known as the CREEK Project began in January 1996. Based on preliminary geomorphological observations of North Inlet creeks, by fall of 1996, eight creeks similar in size and configuration were selected for the study. In January 1997, oysters were added or removed from each creek to equalize oyster biomass at 8 grams dry body weight per cubic meter of bank full water volume in each creek. This stage of the project is referred to as the \"pre-manipulation\" period where all creeks have the same amount of oyster biomass. Sampling of water and nekton began in March 1997. In February 1998, about one year after the first set of water quality, chemistry, biota, and other measurements were made, living oysters were removed from four of the eight creeks (creeks 1, 4, 5, and 8), resulting in zero dry body weight per cubic meter of water at bank full volume. This was done to investigate the role of oyster reefs in controlling levels of dissolved and particulate materials in the water and to evaluate relationships between living oysters and other ecological parameters in the creeks. During the year following oyster removal, all measurements made in the first year were repeated. The second year of the project during which four of the creeks were without oyster biomass was known as the \"manipulation\" stage. The BACI analysis was used to compare data between the two years.In the tidal creeks of North Inlet Estuary, the Eastern oyster C. virginica is an abundant component of the benthic macrofauna that exerts controls on microbial communities by its grazing and nutrient regenerative activities. During the CREEK Microzooplankton project, the effects of oyster activity on North Inlet's microbial food web structure were studied using: (1) water samples collected from tidal creeks with oyster reefs versus tidal creeks without oyster reefs and (2) flow-through flumes. In pair-wise comparisons of creeks with similar hydrography and morphology, the only microbial group found to vary significantly with the presence of oyster reefs was the phototrophic nanoflagellates (pflags), which were 1.25- to 2.25-fold less abundant in creeks with oyster reefs during the summer phytoplankton bloom. Because heterotrophic nanoflagellates (hflags) did not vary in these same comparisons, we hypothesized that preferential feeding for pflags by oysters was responsible for the reduction in pflag abundance. The hypothesis was tested during March and July 1999 using flumes with flowing creek water containing either live oysters or dead oyster shells. Significant reductions in pflags and some types of diatoms were measured in the outflow from live oysters, but oyster effects on other microbial components (hflags, cyanobacteria, and heterotrophic bacterioplankton) were not evident. The flume study demonstrated preferential feeding by oysters on pflags using naturally occurring microbial assemblages. The differences in pflag abundance in creeks with oyster reefs versus creeks without oyster reefs suggests that this grazing activity can affect the structure of natural microbial communities." ;
