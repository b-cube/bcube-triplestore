    dc:description "This raster is used to answer management questions (MQs) about where conservation elements (CEs) overlap with areas of high wind energy potential in the Central Basin and Range Ecoregion. The value indicated in the raster represents a normalized score between 0-1, the lower the value the few species and poorer modeled landscape condition (ecological integrity) expected. The higher the score, the more species and higher condition are expected. This layer seeks to address an article in the BLM Statement of Work 1.1.1 stated, Areas with High Potential for Renewable Energy Development (Required) (The Contractor shall a) locate areas identified (e.g., by DOE, USGS) as suitable for wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass energy production and b) compare these with areas of change-agent disturbance, intact native vegetation, conservation elements of concern, and ecological integrity to c) identify and map the geographic distribution of areas that would have that have the fewest environmental effects from renewable energy development. This raster addressed the SOW by combining three raster layers: NREL/AWS Truewind, 2003, Annual average wind resource potential for the United States at a 50 meter height. The wind power resource estimates were produced by AWS TrueWind using their MesoMap system and historical weather data under contract to Wind Powering America/NREL. This map has been validated with available surface data by NREL and wind energy meteorological consultants. NatureServe landscape condition model, a continuous value raster reflecting modeled (or expected) landscape integrity based on change agent disturbance including invasive annual grass species. The raster contains values between 0-100, lower values representing lower landscape condition and higher values representing high condition. Summary of ecoregion landscape species (conservation elements) by 30m pixel. This species richness map simply shows the number of landscape species distribution in the ecoregion by pixel. Landscape species for the MBR include: Bald Eagle Big brown bat Brazilian free-tailed bat Desert big horn Brewer's Sparrow (Breeding) Brewer's Sparrow (Migratory) Common Kingsnake Coachwhip Cooper's hawk Desert Tortoise - Mohave Population Desert Tortoise - Sonoran Population Prairie Falcon Great Basin Collared Lizard Gila Monster Golden Eagle Glossy Snake Kit Fox Mule Deer Class B Summer Range Mule Deer Class D Winter Range Mule Deer Class F Year Round Range Mohave Rattlesnake Mojave Ground Squirrel Northern Harrier Northern Rubber Boa Northern Sagebrush Lizard Sage Sparrow Sage Thrasher Western Banded Gecko Western Patch-nosed Snake Please see metadata for these layers for additional information. Wind potential at 50m above the ground is classified into classes for of areas suitable for community and commercial scale in the ecoregion. Metadata for this layer indicated that classes 3 and higher may be suitable for energy development while classes 4 and higher may be most likely. NatureServe's experience mapping wind energy in the ecoregion and visually comparing the 50m maps with the newer 80m maps indicated that classes 3 and above represented the most likely areas for development but this not based on any detailed assessment of wind energy siting. Wind energy in particular depends on micro-siting that requires additional field data and more sophisticated models not available in the REA process. The wind potential layer was intersected with the landscape condition raster and the landscape species summary. The landscape condition value was multiplied by the number of landscape species and the resulting value was normalized (a log transformation was applied in the case that the distribution was non-normal). Additional areas were removed that represent lakes, salt flats and areas where management tends to prioritize biodiversity protection (USGAP classes 1 & 2). While this simple assessment model would tend to indicate that there are lower scoring areas that are more appropriate for renewable energy development and higher scoring areas that should be avoided, this raster only represents distributions and knowledge acquired during the REA process and does not reflect field-verified energy potential, infrastructure necessary to support an energy facility, ground condition or the actual number of species potentially located at a site. It is also important to note that this does not factor in all conservation elements or particular elements (wetlands, endangered species) that should be taken into particular consideration regarding the siting of energy facilities." ;
