    dc:description "Salt marshes are the most vulnerable coastal environment (vulnerability index of 10 from a 1-10 scale) to be adversely affected by the oil spill, with the predicted residence times of over 10 years. Saline marshes generally have more oil-sensitive vegetation than freshwater marshes and oil impact on vegetation is most significant in highly organic soils of salt marshes. Cleaning activities such as skimming, oil collection, burning, flushing, use of dispersants and plant cutting can also greatly damage marshes. In addition, the effects of oil spill show seasonal and species specific variations (eg. Spartina alterniflora is more sensitive to oil contamination than Juncus roemerianus). Plants are more sensitive to oiling during the growing season than during the pre-dormancy or dormant season. Since the BP oil spill and cleaning up efforts occurring in summer, the growing season for Spartina spp., we hypothesize that short-term impacts of the spill on salt marshes will be detected. Most post-spill assessments of coastal salt marsh status will be limited to habitat delineation and documentation of change in area. However, assessment of marsh health is essential to the evaluation of the short-term impact of the spill and for the prioritization of future restoration actions. This study will allow the identification of hotspots of early stages of marsh degradation because of the oil spill which can only be delineated by evaluating marsh biophysical characteristics including distribution of chlorophyll content (Chl), green leaf area index (GLAI) (a ratio of green foliage area vs. ground area), and green vegetation fraction (VF) (percentage of green canopy cover). These biophysical characteristics are primary indicators of photosynthetic capacity, nitrogen content and physiological status of vegetation. Monitoring these characteristics through remotely sensed data can help us infer the overall health and productivity of these valuable natural resources on a larger scale so that effective management strategies can be implemented in high priority areas. In order to quantify the short-term impact of the oil spill on the photosynthetic activity and physiological status of the coastal salt marshes, we initiated field surveys in Mississippi and Louisiana salt marshes. We will combine field data with the LANDSAT 30m datasets to retrieve the described biophysical characteristics in Louisiana and Mississippi salt marshes before and after the spill. By examining the biophysical parameters using remotely sensed data, we can infer the overall health and productivity of coastal marshland. The question to be answered through study is: What is the impact of the oil and oil/dispersant on health and productivity of wetlands? The proposed research develops scientific products that can be used to assess marsh physiological characteristics at large spatial scales, which will directly inform restoration and conservation decision-making." ;
