    dc:description "These data were created as part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office for Coastal Management's efforts to create an online mapping viewer called the Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer. It depicts potential sea level rise and its associated impacts on the nation's coastal areas. The purpose of the mapping viewer is to provide coastal managers and scientists with a preliminary look at sea level rise (slr) and coastal flooding impacts. The viewer is a screening-level tool that uses nationally consistent data sets and analyses. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help gauge trends and prioritize actions for different scenarios. The Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer may be accessed at: http://www.coast.noaa.gov/slr This metadata record describes the New York City Weather Forecast Office (OKX WFO) digital elevation model (DEM), which is a part of a series of DEMs produced for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office for Coastal Management's Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer described above. The DEMs created for this project were developed using the NOAA National Weather Service's Weather Forecast Office (WFO) boundaries. This DEM includes the best available lidar known to exist at the time of DEM creation that met project specifications for the New York City WFO, which includes Richmond County in New Jersey and the following counties in New York: Bronx, Kings, Queens, Nassau, New York, Suffolk and along the Hudson River in the following counties: Albany, Columbia, Dutchess, Greene, Rensselaer, Putnam, Westchester (along Hudson River and Long Island Sound), Rockland, Orange, Ulster. Because of the large area this DEM covers, it is split into 2 smaller DEMs. They are named NY_OKX1 and NY_OKX2. The DEM is derived from multiple sources. 1. 2010 New York City Lidar (1 m DEM) - acquired by the City of New York 2. 2010 - 2011 Lidar for the Northeast - United States Geological Survey (USGS) LiDAR data for the remaining coast and Westchester County. 3. 2011 - 2012 NYSDEC New York Coastal Lidar - NY State Dept of Environmental Conservation lidar, covering the Hudson River and the coast of Long Island. 4. 2012 USACE Post Sandy Long Island Lidar - US Army Corps of Engineers Post Super Storm Sandy lidar, covering eastern tip of Long Island Hydrographic breaklines were delineated from LiDAR intensity imagery generated from the LiDAR datasets. The final DEM is hydro flattened such that water elevations are less than or equal to 0 meters. The DEM is referenced vertically to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) with vertical units of meters and horizontally to the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The resolution of the DEM is approximately 5 meters." ;
