    dc:description "Title: Final Map of the Idaho State Forest Resource Assessment. The final composite is a threats/benefits matrix. The key forestry related issues identified by the Assessment stakeholders and further refined by the Core Guidance Team are categorized into two groups. The first included those issues which threaten forests-Forest Health Threats, Risk to Communities and Ecosystems from Uncharacteristic Wildfire, and Potential Loss of Forests and Canopy from Development and Recreation Pressures. The second major group includes those issues for which forests and trees provide benefit-Wildlife and Biodiversity, Water Quality and Quantity, Air Quality, and Sustainable Forest-Based Markets. Each of these issues is considered equal and all have scores that range from 0 through 5, from no threat to high threat, and from no benefit to high benefit. The final State Assessment of Forest Resources priority map is developed by adding the composite threats data scores to the composite benefits data scores. Each 30-meter cell in the resulting map carries with it both a benefits score (1-5) and a threats score (1-5). This can be represented by a five by five matrix with 25 unique values, with areas on the map with the highest threat and highest benefit represented by the matrix value at the upper right, and those with the lowest threat and lowest benefit by the matrix value at the lower left. The 25 unique scores represent a combination of threat level and benefit value, and can be grouped into multiple categories of priority. The lowest priority areas are those that are low threat and low benefit. The highest priorities are those areas which are both high threat and high benefit. From this point, stakeholders can make decisions on the relative priority of various combinations of low to high threats coupled with combinations of low to high benefit. The example above is one possible way cells can be grouped into one of five categories of priority. Stakeholders felt that areas that were high benefit but low threat were more important than those with low benefit but high threat. For this reason, the priorities identified within the matrix are skewed toward benefits. Priority areas in which to focus will be those colored with either red, orange and potentially down into yellow.
