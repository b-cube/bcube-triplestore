    dc:description "The life-history complexity of Snake River fall Chinook salmon has hindered efforts to manage the ESU. In particular, the existence of an overwintering behavior in a portion of the population has complicated our ability to estimate survival through the hydropower system and to assess the benefit of transportation. Many of the yearling migrants move downstream after PIT-tag detection systems are disabled in the fall/winter, and consequently we have limited information on migratory patterns of these fish, which comprise a substantial proportion of returning adults. Further, because of this uncertainty in migratory behavior, major modeling efforts (such as COMPASS modeling and life-cycle modeling of the Interior Columbia Technical Recovery Team) were not able to model the population dynamics of Snake River fall Chinook, and there is a strong desire with the region to rectify this problem. Until we have a better understanding of these life-history patterns, particularly the habitat usage of overwintering juveniles, it will be difficult to efficiently manage the entire ESU. Effective management of reservoir-type fish will require an understanding of the details of their life-history, including the proportion of juveniles that exhibit the strategy, where they over-winter, when they initiate downstream migration in the spring, and estuarine residence time. We propose to continue our ongoing research by conducting micro-chemical and micro-structural analyses of otoliths, sampled from both juveniles and adults. The geochemical analysis of fish otoliths (inner ear balance organs) allows for the reconstruction of important migrational behaviors because the tissue preserves a record of chemical experience of individual fish. By analyzing these chemical signatures, it is possible to identify the location and duration of juvenile Chinook residences during rearing in their natal site, downstream migration from their rearing areas, migration through the hydrosystem, migration through and residence in the estuary and plume, and into the ocean. In addition, the width of daily increments is related to fish growth, and growth trajectories can be back-calculated from daily growth increments. Combining these approaches, we can use the otoliths of returning adult Fall Chinook to quantify seasonal and spatially explicit patterns of habitat usage and growth. We already have made considerable progress in establishing the validity and limitations of this approach for Snake River fall Chinook salmon. In this proposal, we propose to utilize these established methods to describe variability within the population. We also propose to refine current methodology and to devise new methods. As part of our preliminary work, we have access to archived otoliths sampled from juveniles in the 1990s; we collected otoliths from wild returning adults in 2006-2010; and we collected otoliths from PIT-tagged juveniles in 2007-2011. Thus, we are well situated to conduct the research proposed here in a timely manner. Images, increment measurements, and microchemistry trajectories" ;
