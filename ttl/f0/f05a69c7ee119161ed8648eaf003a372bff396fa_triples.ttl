    dc:description "The Gridded Satellite Data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) B1 (or GridSat-B1) provides a uniform set of quality-controlled satellite observations for the visible, infrared window and infrared water vapor channels during the time period of record of the ISCCP B1 dataset. This global Fundamental Climate Data Record (FCDR) provides equal-angle gridded uniform observations of brightness temperatures every 3 hours from 1980 to the present. The ISCCP B1 data have been quality controlled, calibrated, remapped and merged together to provide a nearly global coverage of top of the atmosphere radiances. Long-term temporal normalization is performed via calibration against HIRS channel 12 data during the GridSat period of record. The GridSat IR window channel data has received more extensive inter-satellite calibration than the other channels and is the only variable noted as a CDR by the NOAA CDR Program (other variables such as visible and infrared water vapor data are not yet at NOAA CDR quality). GridSat data are provided in an equal angle map projection, which facilitates the mapping and subsetting of the data. Since the ISCCP B1 native resolution is approximately 8km, the resolution of the equal area grid is 0.07 degrees latitude (approximately 8km at the Equator). The data span the globe in longitude and range from 70 degrees South to 70 degrees North. Areas of satellite overlap are retained by storing data in layers. Data are stored using netCDF-4 file format following the Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions and Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery (ACDD) which facilitate usage with compatible software applications. Channel primary layers (nadir-most observation) are written as 2-dimensional grids in the netCDF file, which facilitates processing of multiple files (e.g., aggregation of multiple times, etc.). Subsequent layers are written as either 2D grids or staggered arrays (1-dimensional arrays that only record data when they exist), whichever is more efficient. The IR data have been applied to tropical cyclones, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), global and regional precipitation monitoring, diurnal variation and outgoing longwave radiation. CDR documentation and source code for the product is included in the data submission. In short, GridSat version 2 differs from version 1 in the following ways: a) 3 channels are now provided instead of just one, b) more quality control on the calibration, navigation and flagging of bad data and c) extension of the period of record." ;
