    dc:description "A two-week field operation was conducted in the John Day Reservoir on the Columbia River to image the floor of the pool, to measure the distribution and thickness of post-impoundment sediment, and to verify these geophysical data with video photography and bottom sediment samples. The field program was a cooperative effort between the USGS Coastal and Marine Geology Team of the Geologic Division and the USGS Columbia River Research Laboratory of the Biological Resources Division. The data collection was completed aboard the R/V ESTERO during September 13-27, 2000. The interest in sediment accumulation in the reservoir was two-fold. First, it was unknown how effective this reservoir was as a sediment trap to material that otherwise would have been transported down-river to the estuary and eventually to the ocean. The recent erosion of beaches along the Washington coast has been attributed to a decreased contribution of sediment from the Columbia River to the coastal system due to the damming of the river. Second, sediment accumulation on the floors of reservoirs along the Columbia River has been suggested to be diminishing salmon spawning grounds. The extent of changes in habitat since construction of the John Day Dam, however, had not been documented. Common data sets were needed to address both of these questions, and for these reasons this geophysical and sampling program was undertaken." ;
