    dc:description "A group of eight intertidal creeks with high densities of oysters, Crassostrea virginica, in North Inlet Estuary, South Carolina, USA were studied using a replicated BACI (Before - After Control - Incident) design in which all creeks are sampled simultaneously. The study known as the CREEK Project began in January 1996. Based on preliminary geomorphological observations of North Inlet creeks, by fall of 1996, eight creeks similar in size and configuration were selected for the study. Geomorphological observations were made in four stages ranging from general to detailed: 1) a general reconnaissance and the selection of the eight creeks, 2) Chris Corbett and Leroy Humphries conducted detailed survey of the internal geomorphology of the selected eight creeks using GIS equipment, 3) Leah Gregory produced a oyster reef map and oyster biomass determination, and 4) Dennis Allen measured and classified all creek bottoms (referred to as Internal Creek Habitat Survey). In January 1997, after the first three stages were complete, oysters were added or removed from each creek to equalize oyster biomass at 8 grams dry body weight per cubic meter of bank full water volume in each creek. This stage of the project is referred to as the \"pre-manipulation\" period where all creeks have the same amount of oyster biomass. Sampling of water and nekton began in March 1997. In February 1998, about one year after the first set of water quality, chemistry, nekton and other measurements were made, living oysters were removed from four of the eight creeks (creeks 1, 4, 5, and 8), resulting in zero dry body weight per cubic meter of water at bank full volume. This was done to investigate the role of oyster reefs in controlling levels of dissolved and particulate materials in the water and to evaluate relationships between living oysters and nekton in the creeks. During the year following oyster removal, all measurements made in the first year were repeated. The second year of the project during which four of the creeks were without oyster biomass was known as the \"manipulation\" stage. The BACI analysis was used to compare data between the two years. In January of 1998, the internal habitats of all eight intertidal creeks (4 in Clambank Creek, 4 in Town Creek) were surveyed manually (on foot) using tape measures during low tide. One tape was positioned along the central axis of the creek and a shorter tape was used to determine the width of the creek bottom (from the lowest points of adjacent creek banks) perpendicular to the axis. The widths were determined every one meter along the length of the main creek and each tributary. A diagram depicting the methods and morphology was created and is called \"InternalCreekDiagram\". A one-meter by one-meter PVC quadrat was used to determine the bottom type of every square meter of each creek. Classification was based according to 16 bottom types. Bottom sediments without living oysters were classified as soft mud, sandy mud, shelly mud, and shelly sand. Twelve other categories were based on low-density shell, medium clusters, or dense aggregates of living oysters present on those four sediment types. These data were used to generate percent values for proportions of the various bottom types. When the data were analyzed along with the other creek morphological characteristics and nekton data, the internal creek habitat categories were condensed from 16 bottom types to two bottom types: mud and shell. The creek bottom types were also divided up on the Nalgene field data sheets by their general location in the creek such as left or right fork, in a pool, and in a submerged area. External characteristics just outside the study creeks were also surveyed in January of 1998. These features also may influence the nekton entrance into the intertidal creek. Bottom types were determined for the intertidal area between the mouth of each intertidal creek and the mean low water (MLW) mark at the edge of the adjacent subtidal creek. Whereas, the distance between the mouth and MLW varied among sites, the lateral extent of the area used for this set of bottom type analyses was defined as ten meters upstream and fifteen meters downstream of the mouths of each intertidal creek. A diagram depicting the methods and morphology was created and is called \"ExternalCreekDiagram\". The same procedure identified for characterizing bottom area and types inside of the intertidal creeks was used for characterizing the area outside of the mouths. Like the internal creek categories, the external creek habitat categories were condensed from 16 bottom types to two." ;
