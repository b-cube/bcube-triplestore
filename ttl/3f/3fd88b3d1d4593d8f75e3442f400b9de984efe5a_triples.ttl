    dc:description "The northern Gulf of Mexico contains a large, potential geopressured-geothermal resource of natural gas dissolved in hotgeopressured brine. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has been investigating this resource under its ongoing geopressured- geothermal program, and there are currently three prospects, two in Louisiana and one in Texas, in various stages of developmental testing. The Gladys McCall # 1 well (Cameron Parish, Louisiana) had a maximum recorded temperature of 288F. This well, which had a maximum recorded temperature of 338F. Another potentially near-term use for a geopressured-geothermal resource, yet untested, is the use of hot brines to aid secondary hydrocarbon recovery in depleted fields containing wells penetrating thick geopressured sandstone reservoirs. Gas-separated brine is disposed of by subsurface injection. Associated with the production and disposal of huge vol umes of geopressured-geothermal brine are the environmental concerns of possible land surface subsidence, fault activation, and contamination offreshwater aquifers. An environmental monitoring program to address these issues has been set up around each test site.Land subsidence and fault activity attributable to geopressuredgeothermal testing are being monitored with the aid of four or five continuous microseismic recording stations at each site (the first of its kind in the Gulf Coast region) and periodically surveyed first-order benchmark networks tied to National Geodetic Survey regional networks.water samples taken periodically from surface stations and groundwater observation wells around each test site are analyzed for possible contaminants originating from geopressured- geothermal production testing and development operations. Data have been collected and analyzed before, during,and after testing. Environmental monitoring of the geopressured-geothermal test sites has so far not shown any long-term detrimental effects." ;
