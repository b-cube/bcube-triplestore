    dc:description "The 2009 MCAS-S datapacks are convenient packages of nationally consistent Australian spatial layers at one-kilometre and five-kilometer resolutions ready for use in MCAS-S. The Datapack is comprised of three types of data: Primary (raster), Mask (raster) and Overlay (vector) data. The downloadable zip file contains a sample MCAS-S project alongside a data folder. Save the entire folder in a location with read/write access. Open the MCAS-S projects to access the data. The structure of this data folder (Primary, Mask, Overlay, and Classified) must be maintained, and data, especially ESRI grids, should not be moved without the use of a GIS program. Users should also read the software user guide. LINEBREAK The map layers cover a broad scope of interests including:LINEBREAK STARTUNORDEREDLIST STARTDOTPOINT biophysical (vegetation, soil, terrain, water, climate,); ENDDOTPOINT STARTDOTPOINT understanding of the relationships between the decision-making process and the available spatial data; ENDDOTPOINT STARTDOTPOINT social (household, community and population characteristics); and ENDDOTPOINT STARTDOTPOINT economic (land use, agricultural commodity, income, land value, rate of return).
