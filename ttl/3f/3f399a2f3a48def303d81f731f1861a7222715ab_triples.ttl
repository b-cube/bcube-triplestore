    dc:description "This image and LiDAR data is the result of private and government entities working together under the guidance of the City of Wahpeton, ND. Fugro Earthdata, Inc. acquired Digital Imagery with sensor ADS80 SH82 for areas of Wahpeton, ND project area April 11, 2012. The project encompassed an area of approximately 24 square miles. A Leica ADS80/SH82 Digital Camera system including an inertial measuring unit (IMU) and a dual frequency airborne GPS receiver was used for the digital image acquisition. Imagery acquisition was performed April 11, 2012 at 2400' AMT (above mean terrain), with 30 percent sidelap between the flight lines. Ground control survey was provided by the City of Wahpeton. Digital orthophotos in TIFF format were produced with a resolution of 0.25 foot utilizing the ADS80/SH82 imagery and the Red River mapping Initiative LiDAR DEM. Delivery was on an External Hard Drive. Fugro Earthdata, Inc. acquired LiDAR data with Fugro's proprietary LiDAR sensor for of Wahpeton, ND project area March 30,2012. The project encompassed an area of approximately 7.6 square miles. A FLIMAP LiDAR system including an inertial measuring unit (IMU) and a dual frequency airborne GPS receiver was used for the LiDAR acquisition. Acquisition was performed March 30, 2012 at 2100' AMT (above mean terrain), with 20 percent sidelap between the flight lines. Ground control survey was provided by the City of Wahpeton. Delivery was on an External Hard Drive." ;
