    dc:description "Progress in an experimental and analytical research program to evaluate and improve the design of downhole heat exchangers (DHEs) for direct applications of geothermal energy is reported. Significant progress has been achieved in characterizing flows in wells and without perforated casings and DHEs installed, determination of energy extraction rates for conventional DHEs in both cased and uncased wells, and utilization of information obtained to develop and substantiate models of heat transfer within the well. Flow characterization was obtained by experimentally measuring temperature and velocity profiles. In uncased wells, there was a relatively large vertical temperature gradient (approximately 0.5{sup 0}C/m) and insignificant measured vertical flow, while for the same wells when cased the temperature gradient was essentially zero (approximately 0.03{sup 0}C/m) and a large vertically upward flow was measured (9 to 14 cm/s as measured with a hot-film anemometer). These show that a significant connection cell is established after installation of the casing. The energy extraction rates for a conventional DHE both before and after casing of a 60 m deep well was experimentally measured. In the uncased well up to 300 kW was obtained while the cased well produced over 500 kW. Analytical heat transfer models were developed for the cased well both with and without DHEs. For the cased well without a DHE, the model predicts flow rates that agree with the measured value within about 30 percent. Further, the energy extraction rates predicted by the models agree even better with the measured values. These models allow the energy extraction rates of design parameter variations to be evaluated. At this stage, only trends can be shown but with additional substantiation they should produce optimum energy extraction designs" ;
