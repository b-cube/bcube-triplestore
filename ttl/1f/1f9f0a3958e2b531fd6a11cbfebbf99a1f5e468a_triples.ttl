    dc:description "These large-scale maps show the boundaries and numbers for all census blocks within an entity. In addition to state and county, these maps show the boundaries, names and codes for American Indian areas, Alaska Native areas, Hawaiian home lands, county subdivisions, places and census tracts. These maps also show and label base features, such as roads, railroads and hydrography. The intent of this series is to show each entity on the fewest number of map sheets possible and at the maximum practical scale, depending on the size and shape of the entity and the density of the census blocks it contains. Census block density affects the display of the census blocks numbers and feature identifiers. Each entity is covered by one or more parent map sheets at a single scale. Inset map sheets at larger scales were created as required to show the map content described above. An index map showing the sheet configuration is included for all entities requiring more than one parent map sheet. The map sheet size is 36 x 32 inches. Each of these large format maps is produced in Adobe's portable document format (PDF). These georeferenced PDF files were created in compliance with the OGC PDF Geo-registration Encoding Best Practice Version 2.2 (OGC project document reference number OGC 08-139r2)." ;
