    dc:description "Since the great demand for domestic manganese ore has arisen as a result of conditions brought about by the war, Arizona has rapidly come to the front as a producer, and the Arizona Bureau of Mines has received a large number of requests for information of all sorts concerning manganese and its ores. As the Bureau's stock of Bulletin 4 on \"Manganese\" was exhausted, it was thought best to prepare a new bulletin on the same subject; and an attempt is made in this booklet to answer every question that has reached the Bureau in the course of the last year or two. Technical terms have been avoided so far as possible, and some very elementary material has been included because experience has shown that it will probably be welcomed by prospectors and others who have not had the advantage of a technical training. Everything presented has a direct bearing upon the development of manganese mining in Arizona. 32 p." ;
