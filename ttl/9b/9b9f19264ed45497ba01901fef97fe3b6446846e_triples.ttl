    dc:description "Since 2009, the NWFSC working in collaboration with the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission has iteratively developed and tested an open escape window bycatch reduction device (BRD) to reduce Chinook salmon and overfished or rebuilding rockfish species (e.g., darkblotched, canary, and widow) bycatch in the Pacific hake fishery. Field work for this ongoing research has been conducted annually. During 2009 and 2010, fish behavior and gear performance were observed using autonomous high-resolution low-light color video camera systems. The BRD has been shown to reduce Chinook salmon bycatch on the order of 50 to 81% and widow rockfish bycatch by 26%. In 2011, the BRD was tested using a recapture net to quantify fish escapement rates under normal commercial fishing operations. Of particular interest was the gears performance under high volume catches of Pacific hake. Results from this study showed reductions in Chinook salmon, yellowtail rockfish, and widow rockfish bycatch by 21.4, 8.3, and 8.3%, respectively. Escapement of Pacific hake, the target species, was 1.2%. In 2012, two versions of a flexible sorting grid rockfish excluder were tested in the U.S. Pacific hake fishery. The designs tested (design-A and design-B) were developed following a collaborative workshop held between gear researchers and Pacific hake fishing industry participants. Tests occurred off Oregon and Washington during 2012 aboard the F/V Perseverance. A recapture net was used to quantify the escapement of Pacific hake and non-target species. Both designs retained a relatively high proportion of Pacific hake (93%). Results showed rockfish bycatch was reduced by 70.2% under design-B and only 15.4% under design-A. A reduction in the catch of Pacific halibut and Chinook salmon, which are prohibited take species, was also noted. FRAM Habitat and Conservation Engineering database" ;
