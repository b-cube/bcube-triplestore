    dc:description "This map details the bedrock geology, structural geology, surficial geology, geomorphology, and geologic hazards of the Fortified Peak 7.5'quadrangle located north of Oracle Junction along the Falcon Divide separating the San Pedro River watershed from the Canada del Oro watershed in Pinal County, Arizona. The northern part of the quadrangle includes the southern portion of the Black Mountains, a dominantly granitic bedrock highland of about 30-square miles that consists of small, rugged peaks with elevations up to about 5600 feet. The maximum elevation in the study area is just below 5000 feet. The southern two-thirds of the quadrangle encompasses a broad, low-relief piedmont of eroded Tertiary basin-filling sediments mantled by Quaternary alluvial materials of variable age. The minimum elevation in the study area is about 3300 feet. Most of the area is undeveloped ranchland, and is a combination of leased state trust land and private land. Urbanization has not occurred in this area as of publication, but proposed housing development along the Willow Springs road in the eastern portion of the quad exemplifies the need to understand the geologic setting and potential hazards of the Fortified Peak quadrangle. Bedrock and surficial geology in the study area were mapped over a period from October 2001 to June 2002 as part of a multiyear mapping program directed at producing complete geologic map coverage for the Phoenix-Tucson metropolitan corridor. The primary product resulting from mapping in the study area is this 1:24,000 layout scale geologic map. Purpose: This new geologic mapping north of Tucson is part of continuing efforts by the AZGS to map the geology of the Phoenix - Tucson urban corridor. This map builds on and complements previous and concurrent surfical geologic mapping efforts in the Tucson area. Supplemental_Information: The mapping was done under the joint State-Federal STATEMAP program, as specified in the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992, and was jointly funded by the Arizona Geologic Survey and the U.S. Geological Survey under STATEMAP Program Contract #01HQAG0098.
