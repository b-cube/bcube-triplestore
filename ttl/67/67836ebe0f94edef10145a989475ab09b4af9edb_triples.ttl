    dc:description "This raster is used to answer the management question (MQ) regarding areas of low potential for renewable energy development (solar, wind, geothermal) that could potentially mitigate impacts to CEs from potential energy development in the Central Basin and Range Ecoregion. The value indicated in the raster represents a score between 0-100, the lower values indicating areas of poor landscape condition (ecological integrity). The higher the score, better landscape conditions are expected. Areas in the middle of the spectrum likely offer areas that present opportunities for mitigation under the logic that these areas are likely to be mildly impacted by change agents and therefore present opportunities for mitigation/restoration. Areas with low scores are likely too impacted by change agents and areas with high scores are likely to already be in good condition. This raster was generated by combining four raster layers: Geothermal Favorability (Coolbagh et al 2005 Preliminary Geothermal Favorability Map of the Great Basin, University of Nevada, Reno); Filtered direct normal solar resource data for the Southwest United States (National Renewable Energy Laboratories and SUNY Albany, 2010). This layer represents areas with less than 5 degrees slope that have potential for solar energy development; NREL/AWS Truewind, 2003, Annual average wind resource potential for the United States at a 50 meter height. The wind power resource estimates were produced by AWS TrueWind using their MesoMap system and historical weather data under contract to Wind Powering America/NREL. This map has been validated with available surface data by NREL and wind energy meteorological consultants; NatureServe landscape condition model, a continuous value raster reflecting modeled (or expected) landscape integrity based on change agent disturbance including invasive annual grass species. The three renewable energy layers were combined with the landscape condition raster and the landscape species summary. While this simple assessment model would tend to indicate that there areas with low potential for renewable energy development, future developments in technology and other factors beyond the scope of the REA may affect the suitability of any given site for renewable energy development. Perhaps more importantly, the selection of mitigation sites would require a vast array of other criteria not available within the REA process. Such sites would need to be field-verified and encompass the legal framework and mitigation needs of a particular project. It is also important to note that this does not factor in particular conservation elements (wetlands, endangered species) that may be targets of a mitigation project or change agents that would preclude mitigation (e.g. urban development). Extractive energy, especially oil and gas were not addressed due to the low potential for this energy source in the ecoregion." ;
