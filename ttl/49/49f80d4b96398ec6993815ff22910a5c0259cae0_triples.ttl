    dc:description "This mineral resource data was produced as part of the Mineral Resource Map of Northern Ireland via a commission from the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment. The work resulted in a series of 21 data layers which were used to generate a series of six digitally generated maps. This work was completed in 2012 with one map for each of the six counties (including county boroughs) of Northern Ireland at a scale of 1:100 000. This data and the accompanying maps are intended to assist strategic decision making in respect of mineral extraction and the protection of important mineral resources against sterilisation. They bring together a wide range of information, much of which is scattered and not always available in a convenient form. The data has been produced by the collation and interpretation of mineral resource data principally held by the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland and was funded via a commission from the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment. These layers display the spatial data of the mineral resources of Northern Ireland. There are a series of layers which consist of: Bedrock: Clay, Coal & Lignite, Coal lignite proven, Conglomerate, Dolomite, Igneous and meta-igneous rock, Limestone, a 100m buffer layer on the Ulster White Limestone, Meta-sedimentary rocks, Perlite, Salt, sandstone and Silica Sand. Superficial (unconsolidated recent sediments) : Sand & gravel and Peat. The data except for the salt and proven lignite resource layers was derived from the 1:50 00 and 1:250 000 scale DigMap NI dataset. A user guide The Mineral Resources of Northern Ireland digital dataset (version 1) OR/12/039 describing the creation and use of the data is available. A companion set of data with the internal boundaries retained is also available." ;
