    dc:description "This research is aimed at the demonstration of the use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in aquaculture for the development of process improvement. This work is being conducted by Dr. Joyce Cooper, Mechanical Engineering, University of Washington in cooperation with NWFSC staff. The project will assess the Montlake Process. Specifically, because currently as much as 600,000 tons of fish processing wastes in Alaska are discharged directly into the ocean which can result in large anoxia areas and have serious impacts on benthic animals, an opportunity exists to instead recover these wastes for a variety of uses. To utilize this waste, the NWFSC has developed the Montlake Process to produce a high protein-low ash meal, oil, bone meal, and gelatin from processing wastes. The Montlake Process will reduce the life cycle contribution to climate change because of the following: (a) More efficient thermal design (b) The ability to use fish oil to reduce diesel or electrical inputs, and (c) The use of a waste product in the place of virgin resources. This work will develop the models and data needed for LCAs of the Montlake Process and the conventional, ocean dumping-based system. The study goal includes not only model and data development and assessment but also consideration of discharge regulations in Alaska and the evaluation of the Montlake Process as a Best Available Technology for salmon fisheries. Recommendations specific to the Montlake Process will include a comparative assessment to the conventional process, an evaluation of the processes and flows contributing most to the impacts assessed (using contribution and sensitivity analyses), and recommendations for system improvement. Continuing research will include the investigation of the integration of LCA into feed optimization for aquaculture systems. The goal of this work is to develop a framework to facilitate optimal feed selection and management on the basis of minimizing life cycle environmental, economic, and social impacts with consideration given to feed formulation, species-specific dietary requirements and the availability of and need for local and global resources. Existing systems for feed selection and formulation have been developed for cost optimization/returns maximization (e.g., for aquaculture by Creative Formulation Concepts; by Barrows, Riche, and other ARS researchers at the US Department of Agriculture; in the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Nutrition Laboratory through the Brazilian Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture NutriAqua Project; for beef production by researchers at the University of Georgia). These systems are based on databases representing nutritional requirements and feed formulations that combine with formulation and supplement cost data as well as data on the costs of on-site feed supplementation, mixing, and drying requirements.
