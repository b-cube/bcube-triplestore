    dc:description "This data set represents the most recent changes for the Wind Development Planning Areas in the Atlantic. Wind Planning Areas in this dataset represent up to six different types of announcements within the US Federal Register that can be used to show the current status of an area that is being considered for Wind Power Development. Individual projects are listed by state below. Previous Wind Planning Areas that are now designated as leases can be found on the BOEM Leases Shapefile. Metadata for the leases can be found here. MassachusettsThe Wind Energy Area is located off the coast of Massachusetts beginning approximately 12 nmi south of Martha's Vineyard and 13 nautical miles southwest of Nantucket. It covers an area of approximately 300,672 hectares (742,974 acres).Federal Register notices12/29/2010 Request for Interest(RFI)02/06/2012 Call for Information02/06/2012 - Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement05/30/2012 Wind Energy Area(WEA)11/02/2012 Environmental Assessment(EA)06/17/2014 - Proposed Sale Notice (PSN) For more information: Massachusetts State Activities Home PageNew YorkThe New York Power Authority (NYPA), Long Island Power Authority (LIPA), and Consolidated Edison (ConEd) worked together to propose an offshore wind power project south of Long Island, approximately 13 nmi off Rockaway Peninsula.
