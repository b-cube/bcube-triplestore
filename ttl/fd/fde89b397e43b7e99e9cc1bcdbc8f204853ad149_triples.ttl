    dc:description "Three main criteria are used as an initial basis for screening source locations; availability of large quantities of beach compatible sand, levels of contamination, and the location of the source relative to the potential southern Monterey Bay receiver site. Sediments with contamination are typically eliminated from further consideration for beach nourishment. Potential sources are then targeted, using the Tier I evaluation criteria of the Sand Compatibility and Opportunistic Use Program (SCOUP) Plan (Moffatt and Nichol Engineers, 2006), for more detailed compatibility studies.In this Coastal RSM Plan, available information was collated on the physical and chemical characteristics of the potential source sediments. The essential data include particle size, and chemical signatures (metals and other analytes). This is defined as a Tier I analysis in the SCOUP (Moffatt and Nichol Engineers, 2006). From these data, provisional recommendations are made regarding the suitability of the source sediments for placement at the potential receiver site, which should then be carried forward into a more detailed Tier II analysis. Tier II analysis requires sampling and testing for particle size distribution, chemistry, and physical properties, at each of the source sites and the potential receiver site providing a definitive statement regarding the suitability of the source sediments for placement at the receiver site. The Tier I analysis carried out for this Coastal RSM Plan targets five potential sources of sand for beach nourishment, which are described in Sections 6.1 to 6.5. Locations compiled by PWA for Southern Monterey Bay Coastal Regional Sediment Management Plan (AMBAG, 2008)." ;
