    dc:description "This Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS) data set, produced by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), contains areas designated as undeveloped coastal barriers in accordance with the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA), 16 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., as amended. The boundaries used to create the polygons herein were compiled between 4/1/2007 and 12/18/2014 from the official John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System CBRS maps. The majority of the boundaries were digitized from the official paper maps. In cases where the official map was created through digital methods, the digital boundary was used. As maps are revised this data set will be updated with the new boundaries. This data set contains CBRS polygons that have varying levels of horizontal accuracy depending on the methods used for digitization of the boundaries, and the age and quality of the official CBRS map. The different levels of horizontal accuracy are described below in the horizontal accuracy statement. These digital polygons are only representations of the CBRS boundaries shown on the official CBRS maps and are not to be considered authoritative. The Service is not responsible for any misuse or misinterpretation of this digital data set, including use of the data to determine eligibility for federal financial assistance such as federal flood insurance. CBRS maps are either enacted by Congress or adopted administratively by the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary), and are maintained by the Service. Copies of the official CBRS maps are available for viewing at Service s Headquarters office and are also available to view or download at http://www.fws.gov/cbra/maps. CBRS boundaries viewed using the CBRS Mapper or the shapefile are subject to misrepresentations beyond the Service s control, including misalignments of the boundaries with third party base layers and misprojections of spatial data. The official CBRS map is the controlling document and should be consulted for all official determinations. Official determinations are recommended for all properties that are in close proximity (within 150 feet of Tier 1 and 20 feet of Tier 2) of a CBRS boundary. For an official determination of whether or not an area or specific property is located within the CBRS, please follow the procedures found at http://www.fws.gov/cbra/determinations.html. For any questions regarding the CBRS, please contact your local Service field office or email CBRA@fws.gov. Contact information for Service field offices can be found at http://www.fws.gov/offices." ;
