    dc:description "Two cruises aboard the NOAA ship Townsend Cromwell were conducted during the following periods: 22 August-17 September 1990 and 18 February-9 March, 1992. Collectors included George Boehlert, Bruce Mundy, Ilse Hamann, Donald Kobayashi, Christopher Wilson, Ronald Yoshimoto, William Watson, and Christine Thacker. Plankton and midwater trawl samples were taken in the vicinity of Palmyra Atoll. Larvae were sampled below the surface with a 1 m2 multiple opening-closing net and environmental sensing system (MOCNESS), a 1 m diameter dropped ring net and light trap (in the atoll lagoon), and at the sea surface with a 0.49 m2 Manta net modified to take surface samples to a depth of 0.7 m. All plankton nets were constructed of 0.333 mm Nitex mesh. Estimates of water volumes filtered by both gear types were based on mechanical flowmeter readings. Samples were taken at a variety of depths. MOCNESS hauls were 12 minutes duration for each net (in 1990 targeting strata of 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, 80-100, 100-120, 120-160, and 160-200 m; in 1992 targeting strata at 0-30, 30-60, and 60-100 m, with a few additional samples at 100-130 m), fished in a stepped oblique fashion from deep to shallow with mean tow speeds of approximately 75 cm/sec; the tow speed was adjusted to maintain a net mouth angle near 45\". Neuston tows (0-0.75 m) were 24 minutes, taken during the mid-point of the MOCNESS tows. The drop net was used in the lagoon, targeting vertical samples at 0-10, 0-20, and 0-30 m. The light trap fished at the surface in the atoll lagoon at night. Juvenile fish were sampled with a Cobb Midwater trawl and a 1.8 m mouth-width Isaacs-Kidd midwater trawl, targeting depths of 0-120 m. All fish larvae and juveniles were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible by Bruce C. Mundy." ;
