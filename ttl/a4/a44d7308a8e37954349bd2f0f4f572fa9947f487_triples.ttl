    dc:description "The intensity of ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching the surface of Earth was measured from August 1996 to July 2004 as part of the GSFC TOMS EP/TOMS satellite program at NASA. These data have been processed by NASA to isolate the amount of erythemal UV light (the UV-B spectrum of UV light that is most harmful to organisms; 315-280 nm wavelength) that reaches Earth's surface (data available at http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NASA/.GSFC/.TOMS/.EPTOMS/.monthly/.uv/) (S21). Data are reported as the average Joules (J) per m2 per month at one-degree cell 12 (~110 km by 110 km) resolution for the areas between 65 S to 65 N. We used these data to calculate the climatological mean and standard deviation of erythemal UV light reaching each 1-degree cell for each month. Our measure of anomalously high values (i.e., a potential response to climate change) was the number of times between 2000 and 2004 that the monthly average exceeded the climatological mean + 1 standard deviation. These values were summed across the 12 months to provide a single value, ranging from 0-19, representing the number of anomalous values in that particular location over the entire 5 years. We did not use the metric of change in these anomalous values from the early period to the current period, as was done for SST data, since the entire UV dataset covers only 9 years. As with SST data above, our approach to modeling the impact of changing UV on ecosystems assumes equivalent impacts within and among different regions. Local factors such as small-scale shading and oceanography and the presence of UV-resistant species may help make some locations more tolerant than others. The data also only span 9 years, so historical levels of UV, against which to compare current levels, are not known. However, if the strong correlation between SST anomaly values for recent and historic years (see above) is generalizable, the UV results for the most recent years are likely an adequate measure of spatial variance in the impact of UV on current ecosystems. These data also do not include polar regions and so cumulative impact scores in these regions will be slightly underestimated, however most of the southern polar region is land (Antarctica) and much of the northern polar region is covered in ice for much of the year where we do not calculate cumulative impact scores." ;
