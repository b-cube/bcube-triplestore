    dc:description "EPA/NOAA/NASA CISNet Partnership The Coastal Intensive Site Network (CISNet) was developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and is composed of intensive, long-term monitoring and research sites around the U.S. marine and Great Lakes coasts. The EPA and NOAAs focus for funding within the CISNet partnership is to support research and monitoring programs, and in particular, those that utilize ecological indicators and investigate the ecological effects of environmental stressors. NASAs funding focus is the development of remote sensing capabilities that can enhance and supplement the in situ research and monitoring programs selected for funding by the EPA and NOAA. The CISNet partnership has three main objectives: 1. To develop a sound scientific basis for understanding ecological responses to anthropogenic stresses in coastal environments, including the interaction of exposure, environment/climate, and biological/ecological factors in the response, and the spatial and temporal nature of these interactions, 2. To demonstrate the value of developing data from selected sites intensively monitored to examine the relationships between changes in environmental stressors, including anthropogenic and natural stresses, and ecological response, and 3. To provide intensively monitored sites for development and evaluation of indicators of change in coastal systems. Summers, Kevin, Andrew Robertson and Barbara Levinson. 2000. Development of the Coastal Intensive Site Network (CISNet). Environ. Monit. Assess. 64(1):379-390. (ERL,GB 1076). Baruchs CISNet Project The Belle W. Baruch Institute for Marine and Coastal Sciences received funding under the CISNet EPA/NOAA/NASA partnership to further these objectives. Baruchs CISNet project originally proposed to investigate two very different estuaries, North Inlet and Winyah Bay. However, after conducting a preliminary assessment of several South Carolina estuaries, investigators decided to include portions of the ACE Basin Estuary instead of Winyah Bay. While the North Inlet and ACE Basin estuaries are similar in terms of salinity, temperature, and tidal exchange, they differ in terms of the influence of the freshwater drainage basin. North Inlet is a relatively small estuary with minimal fresh water input (nutrient impoverished); ACE Basin is larger and is characterized by a much greater riverine drainage influence (a highly fertile estuary). As a result, they display extreme differences in nutrient loading, nutrient dynamics, and productivity. Baruchs aim was to address the differences in nutrient loading between these two estuaries, and the expected impact on the regulation of their food webs, by addressing these three main hypotheses: 1. The composition and abundance of ACE Basin and North Inlet bacterial and phytoplankton communities will differ and will vary as functions of nutrient availability. 2. Bacterial and phytoplankton communities form associations which vary in complexity (species diversity) as a function of nutrient availability. 3. At a landscape-scale, remote sensing of the concentration of chlorophyll in emergent wetland vegetation will provide a quantitative index of wetland condition, and will demonstrate differences in nutrient loading among estuaries. Several subprojects were initiated to address these hypotheses. Information on the other subprojects that make up Baruchs CISNet project can be found below under Other CISNet Datasets. Information on the relevant subproject follows: CISNet Water Quality Monitoring Subproject Water quality samples were collected seasonally along salinity gradients at 5 locations in the ACE Basin Estuary, and 5 locations in the North Inlet Estuary. Samples were taken bimonthly from July to September 1999, from April to October 2000, and from March to September 2001. Water temperature, salinity, pH, specific conductivity, and dissolved oxygen values were measured, and samples were analyzed for nutrients (Total Nitrogen Whole, Total Nitrogen Filtered, Total Phosphorus Whole, Total Phosphorus Filtered, Dissolved Organic Carbon, Nitrate-Nitrite, Orthophosphate, Ammonia, and Silicate), suspended solids (Total and Organic), and chlorophyll a. Light profiles were also recorded. These samples were taken in tandem with the phytoplankton pigment and bacterial samples used for other CISNet subprojects." ;
