    dc:description "The objective of this project is to compile available San Francisco Bay regional seafloor mapping data and to interpret newly collected data provided through the CSMP and USGS to construct benthic habitat and geologic maps of the submerged lands of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GGNRA).Data used for the creation of the potential benthic habitat map and geologic map consists of multibeam bathymetry, acoustic backscatter, and sediment samples. Depth grids created from bathymetric surveys were processed to a horizontal resolution of one to two meters. Backscatter intensities were processed into imagery with a one meter resolution. All data were compiled and displayed for interpretation using ESRI ArcGIS software, ArcMap v.9.2.. The process utilizes editing a shapefile within ArcMap, beginning with the construction of polygons to delineate benthic features. A feature is an area with common characteristics which can be characterized as a single potential habitat type or geologic type. The boundaries and extents of these features were determined from the bathymetric data. Generally, interpretations were made at a scale of 1:5,000 or greater west of the Golden Gate, and approximately 1:2,000 east of the Golden Gate. All areas within the offshore park boundary were interpreted at less than 1:2000.Dataset was submitted to CSMW as part of the San Francisco Littoral Cell Coastal Regional Sediment Management Plan (2012)." ;
