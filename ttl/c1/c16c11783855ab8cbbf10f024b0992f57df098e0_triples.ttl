    dc:description "The data contained in the SPS database are primarily summary data, compiled at the population level and available through the SPS website https://www.webapps.nwfsc.noaa.gov/SPS. The database also includes a limited number of series representing the aggregate returns to groups of populations (e.g., Lower Granite Dam counts) or counts of spawners within a subsection of a population where expansions to the population level were not feasible. The information used to develop the population level estimates comes from a variety of sources, but mostly originates from the monitoring programs conducted by state and tribal fishery agencies. The Technical Recovery Teams and NWFSC staff have processed this information to provide an estimate of spawning abundance at the population level. A variety of different types of information (e.g., redd counts, dam counts, carcass surveys, tag recoveries, scale analysis) forms the basis of the information in the database, and where possible, the database provides references to these information sources. It is important to recognize that spawning abundance values and other information in the SPS database are not \"facts\" that are known with certainty. Rather, they are estimates based on a variety of sources of information, some known with greater precision or accuracy than others. Ideally, these estimates would be characterized by a known level of statistical uncertainty. However, for the most part, such a statistical characterization is either not possible or has not been attempted, and the database reports only the best estimates of the values. In all cases, there is some degree of uncertainty surrounding these estimates. The NWFSC intends to work with our state and tribal partners to keep the SPS database as up-to-date as possible, and new annual estimates will be added as they become available.
