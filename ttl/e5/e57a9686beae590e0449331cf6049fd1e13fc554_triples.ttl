    dc:description "This data set is a part of Ecotrust's project entitled: Establishing a Baseline and Assessing Initial Spatial and Economic Change in the California North Central Coast Commercial Fisheries. This project is a component of the California North Central Coast Marine Protected Area Baseline Monitoring Project that is designed to characterize the ecological and socioeconomic conditions and changes within the North Central Coast Region since MPA implementation. The North Central Coast study region extends from the north at Alder Creek to the south at Pigeon Point. This data set consists of data collected in the spring of 2012 from fisheries mapping interviews conducted with commercial fishermen who had California halibut hook and line landings in the California North Central Coast in 2011. During interviews fishermen were asked to map their fishing grounds for 2011 and determine the relative importance of each fishing ground by allocating 100 pennies across their fishing grounds for this fishery. The spatial data from these interviews were then combined through an aggregation process where the weighted fishing grounds each fisherman gave were further weighted by their ex-vessel revenue from the California halibut hook and line fishery in 2011. This created spatial data sets for each port for this fishery. For regional or all port data sets, port level data was aggregated by weighting each port by the port s total ex-vessel revenue in 2011 for the fishery based on California Department of Fish and Wildlife commercial landings data. This data set represents the spatial extent and relative value of California halibut hook and line commercial fishing grounds for the North Central Coast Region in the year 2011." ;
