    dc:description "1.Conduct tandem 20 cm (153 mesh size) and 60 cm (505 mesh size) Bongo net tows at all grid stations (Table 2) working from west to east. Deployments were made aft from the hydrographic winch, with a Seacat CTD mounted just above the nets to monitor their depth during deployment. Tows were to a maximum of 200 m or 5 b?? 10 m off bottom. 60 cm Net 1 (or side A) bongo sample was immediately preserved for ichthyoplankton. 60 cm Net 2 (or side B) bongo sample was sorted for fish larvae, quantitatively retaining all zooplankton, and then preserved for zooplankton. The sorted fish larvae were placed in 20 ml glass scintillation vials filled with genetic-grade ethanol. 2.Conduct 505 B5m mesh neuston net tows at all grid stations. Deployment was made starboard from the mid-ship crane. 3.Conduct CTD casts, with bottles triggered for macro-nutrients, chlorophyll a and microzooplankton at a subset of stations. Chlorophyll size-fractionation (20 B5m only) were be done at all stations b?? a replicate subset of macronutrients samples were prefiltered prior to freezing. Size-fractionated chlorophyll was extracted on fresh filters without freezing, while total chlorophyll was frozen for later analysis 4.Primary production incubations and iron measurements originally planned for this cruise could not be conducted due to schedule overlap with the Thompson." ;
