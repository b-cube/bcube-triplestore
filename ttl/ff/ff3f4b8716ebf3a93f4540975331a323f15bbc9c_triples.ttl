    dc:description "DAWR collects `trip ticket? or `purchase invoice? data from vendors that buy fish directly from the fishermen. Similar to the trip ticket system in Saipan, this is a voluntary program and has very few participating vendors. This was created by WPacFIN in the early 1980?s and data back to July 1979 were recovered and entered into the data system. DAWR-based staff does the main data processing for this system. Although there have been very few vendors participating in this voluntary program over the years, the most major vendor on Guam, the Guam Fishermen?s Coop, has always participated and it is estimated that, depending on the year in question, between 50% and 90% of the commercial landings made on Guam have come through the Coop. These data are considered highly confidential." ;
