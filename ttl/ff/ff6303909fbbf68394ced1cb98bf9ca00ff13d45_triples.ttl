    dc:description "This data is a model of potential habitat connectivity for the Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) for the Mojave Basin and Range ecoregion. Methods for developing this data set: The connectivity modeling software Circuitscape 3.5.7 was used to develop the desert tortoise model. The two inputs needed to model tortoise habitat connectivity with this software were developed in ArcGIS 10. Habitat Input: The USGS model for desert tortoise habitat potential was used to create a series of 167 points representing tortoise habitat throughout the Mojave Basin and Range ecoregion. Areas with high habitat potential (0.7 or higher) were selected and converted to polygons. Polygons smaller than 4,000 acres were removed. Point centroids were generated for these habitat polygons, and additional points were manually added within the habitat polygons to create a more extensive distribution of tortoise habitat areas to connect. The resulting points were converted to an ascii format to be assessed for landscape-scale connectivity across the Mojave Basin and Range ecoregion in Circuitscape 3.5.7. Conductance Input: A landscape conductance surface for desert tortoise was built in ArcGIS using three inputs: 1) the USGS tortoise habitat potential model (Nussear et al. 2009), 2) the Landscape Condition Model, and 3) an index of steepness. The inverse of the steepness was calculated. The habitat potential, landscape condition model, and steepness inverse were multiplied together then multiplied by 1000 to get an initial conductance raster. Pixels meeting any of the following criteria were coded as NoData: having a habitat potential <0.1 (reflecting almost no habitat potential) in the USGS tortoise model; having a landscape condition value < 50 (areas with high intensity urban/developed footprints); footprints of existing solar projects; and the footprint of the Large-Scale Translocation Site (Desert Tortoise Translocation Area) in southeastern NV. Coding these as NoData forces Circuitscape to treat these areas as complete barriers to tortoise movement. (Solar projects and the LSTS are fenced with tortoise exclusion fencing.) The final conductance surface was resampled to 500 m pixels and converted to ascii format for use in Circuitscape. High values in the conductance surface indicate high potential for tortoise movement or gene flow; low values indicate low potential. The connectivity modeling software Circuitscape (3.5.7) was used to generate the actual connectivity raster. It was run in pairwise mode; within the software, each possible combination of pairs of habitat points was evaluated for connection between the two points, and the resulting set of pairwise comparisons was averaged to provide a single overall connectivity result. The \"Value\" attribute is the raw connectivity value; higher numbers indicate greater (more intense and constrained) connectivity potential. Limitations: While this model provides a relative indication of areas of greater or lesser potential for habitat connectivity, it is not designed to account for species-specific requirements for size and spatial configuration of potential habitat connections and it has not been field-verified. Areas of potential connection require further evaluation to determine whether desert tortoise currently inhabits these areas and whether the spatial configuration of these areas is expected to be adequate for tortoise movement and gene flow over the long term." ;
