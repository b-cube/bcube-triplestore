    dc:description "This line layer represents base flood elevations (BFEs) created from FEMA Flood Rate Insurance Maps (FIRM). BFE lines indicate the rounded whole-foot water surface elevation of the 1% annual chance flood. BFE lines are required in riverine AE zones. AE Zones are areas inundated by 1% annual chance flooding (100-year flood), for which BFEs have been determined. Of 92 counties in Indiana, 86 are included in this DFIRM data set and 62 counties have BFE information. The following 6 counties are omitted  Allen, DeKalb, Johnson, Lake, Marion, Vanderburgh. These counties will be completed as work on the IDNR project progresses. This floodplain data may be used with an associated floodplain polygon shapefile and cross sections line shapefile. IDNR documentation states - This database is an interim version of the Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) Database. It does not fully meet all DFIRM specifications as found in Guidelines and Specifications for Flood Hazard Mapping Partners, Appendix L: Guidance for Preparing Draft Digital Data and DFIRM Database. A fully compliant product is expected in 2005. The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12,000. The DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital FIS database that serves to archive the information collected during the FIS." ;
