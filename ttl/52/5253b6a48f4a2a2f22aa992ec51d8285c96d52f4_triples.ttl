    dc:description "NAVTEQ Administrative Area Boundaries 3 (County Boundaries) for Region 9. There are five Administrative Area Boundaries layers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). These layers contain the boundaries that divide countries into administrative areas such as country, state, county, city, or settlement. These designations vary on a country by country basis. (In the US for example, the AdminBndy2 layer contains State boundaries, the AdminBndy3 layer contains County boundaries, and the AdminBndy4 layer contains City boundaries.) See Administrative Level Coding and Boundary Features in the NAVSTREETS manual for a list of the administrative area types by country. This layer is used for map visualisation. Note that an Administrative Area Boundary is represented by multiple region objects when it has names in multiple languages. This dataset is a subset of the full NAVTEQ NAVSTREETS database. With the most accurate geometry, the highest number of attributes, and the most complete detailed coverage, NAVTEQ data is the ideal resource for Fleet applications that offer route planning and optimization, and GIS geocoding and other applications that require superior accuracy, and location-enabled services, from Personal Navigation Devices (PNDs) and mobile social networking, to location-enabled entertainment, leisure, and business applications. Products, applications, and services that rely on digital mapping data can ensure superior performance and accuracy by using NAVSTREETS. NAVTEQ data drives most in-vehicle navigation systems around the world, the top routing Web sites, and the leading brands of wireless devices. Designed for rapid display and retrieval of attributes for routing, NAVTEQ data additionally provides support for express mail services, emergency and government routing plans, efficient field service management, wireless Location Based Services (LBS), and delivery of real-time traffic information. <br><A HREF=\"https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid={B5F3F5CE-D9E6-43BB-A581-6085A3F82741}\" target=\"_blank\"><IMG SRC=\"https://edg.epa.gov/clipship/doc/metadata.png\" BORDER=0></A>" ;
