    dc:description "This is the 1st release of the fourth version of an Everglades Depth Estimation Network (EDEN) digital elevation model (DEM) generated from certified airborne height finder (AHF) and airboat collected ground surface elevations for the Greater Everglades Region. Collectively, these data are referred to as \"High Accuracy Elevation Data\" (HAED). This version differs from the previous elevation model (EDEN_EM_OCT07) in several ways. First, the kriging algorithm applied to newly modeled subareas was changed from ordinary to universal kriging - resulting in slightly lower errors during cross-validation and accuracy assessment. Second, a previously omitted area in the southern portion of the Big Cypress National Preserve (BCNP) and the northwestern corner of the Everglades National Park (ENP) has been filled. Third, to increase accuracy in Water Conservation Area 1 (WCA1), the most challenging EDEN subarea from an elevation modeling standpoint, the Conservation area is subdivided into 3 zones (North, Central, South). Boundaries between the North, Central and South zones are based upon landscape units defined in the CERP Monitoring and Assessment Plan, Part 1, Figure 3-20 on p. 3-38 (p. 36 in the pdf file) at http://www.evergladesplan.org/pm/recover/recover_docs/map/MAP_3.1_GE.pdf. The South landscape unit (representing approximately the southern third of WCA1) was further divided into two zones (east and west, termed \"Southeast\" and \"Southwest\") based on marked changes in slope and aspect data generated from a DEM of the South landscape unit as a whole. Division of WCA1 into 4 zones reduces errors estimated by comparing DEM modeled water depths with those measured by EDEN Principal Investigators in the field. Subdivision of the South landscape unit into east and west zones resulted in lower error estimates for the Southeast zone without significantly affecting (i.e., improving or degrading) the quality of the Southwest zone - an area where DEM modeling is most challenging. To reduce artificial breaks in elevation along WCA1 subarea boundaries, models were overlapped by 1 cell at these boundaries and, for the North, Central and South zone boundaries, overlapping model values were averaged. For the boundaries between the Southwest and Southeast zones, cell values were \"blended\" based on weighted distance from the boundary edge. Finally, points along the North / Central and Central / South zone edges were subjectively selected and changed by adding or subtracting 0.03 meters (3 cm) to particular cells based on nearby cell values. This slightly reduces apparent artifacts without drastically affecting the integrity of the model. The EDEN offers a consistent and documented dataset that can be used to guide large-scale field operations, to integrate hydrologic and ecological responses, and to support biological and ecological assessments that measure ecosystem responses to the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. To produce historic and near-real time maps of water depths, the EDEN requires a system-wide DEM of the ground surface." ;
