    dc:description "This dataset shows the model grid cells that are used in the Eastern Snake Plain Modeling effort. For more information contact John Lindgren at 208 327-7900. The existing Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer (ESPA) model is increasingly being used for water management decisions, and the Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR) intends to further use the model for conjunctive administration of surface and ground water. The present calibration of the ESPA model is based on hydrologic conditions representative of a single year (1980). This results in some uncertainty when the model is used to represent hydrologic conditions that are different from the conditions under which it was calibrated. Calibration using multi-year data sets will include a wider range of Snake Plain hydrologic conditions and will improve the confidence in the ESPA model. The purpose of the work described by the workplan herein is to improve the ESPA model and estimate confidence limits on parameters used in the model. Specific objectives include the following: Establish a coordinated approach to improve the ground water modeling of the ESPA to address the demands of current and emerging water resource issues within a reasonable cost and timeframe; Collect and analyze data that will enable more reliable simulations of ground-water flow in the Eastern Snake Plain to improve quantification of ground- and surface water interaction; Enhance, refine, re-calibrate, and document the existing model based on new data and improved calibration techniques; and Refine simulations of response to ground-water stresses on the basis of the recalibrated ESPA model. This workplan describes a multi-year effort that will be accomplished through collaborative partnerships, with technical advice provided by the Eastern Snake Hydrologic Modeling Committee. The committee is composed of experts and technical representatives from participating organizations and interested stakeholders. The ESPA model enhancement will be accomplished through collaborative partnerships between IDWR, Idaho Power Company (IPCo), the University of Idaho (UI), the Idaho Water Resources Research Institute (IWRRI), the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)." ;
