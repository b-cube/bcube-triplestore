    dc:description "These metadata are specifically for the State of Maine, one state in the national compilation of state geologic map databases. The digital geologic state map data of Maine was prepared by the Maine Geological Survey in cooperation with the USGS between 1987-1994. Subsequent editing of the spatial data by the USGS was limited to fitting a standardized state boundary to the data, standardizing the arc coding, reprojecting the data, and minor edits of arc or polygon attributes to conform with the paper map. This open-file report is one of several that present the preliminary results of the USGS Mineral Resources Program activity to compile a national-scale geologic map database to support national and regional level projects, including mineral resource and geoenvironmental assessments. The only comprehensive sources of regional- and national-scale geologic maps are state geologic maps with scales ranging from 1:100,000 to 1:1,000,000. Digital versions of these state maps form the core of what is presented here. Because no adequate geologic map exists for the state of Alaska, it is being compiled in regional blocks that also form part of this national database. It is expected that this series will completed by approximately the end of 2007. These maps and databases are being released in blocks of states or, in the case of Alaska, as compiled blocks of 1:250,000-scale quadrangles as chapters in this series. For Alaska, formal maps as well as databases are being published here, whereas for the conterminous U.S. only state databases and preview graphics are presented, because published maps for most states already exist. For Alaska these regional compilations will form the base for compiling a new geologic map of the state. As documented in CONUSdocumentationNENJ.pdf, standards for the conterminous U.S. are somewhat different than those for Alaska and Hawaii." ;
