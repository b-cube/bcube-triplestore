    dc:description "This raster is used to answer management questions (MQs) about where conservation elements (CEs) overlap with areas of high solar energy potential in the Mojave Basin and Range Ecoregion. The value indicated in the raster represents a number that is the product of the landscape condition value and number of landscape species. The lower the value the few species and poorer modeled landscape condition (ecological integrity) expected. The higher the score, the more species and higher condition are expected. This layer seeks to address an article in the BLM Statement of Work 1.1.1 stated, Areas with High Potential for Renewable Energy Development (Required) (The Contractor shall a) locate areas identified (e.g., by DOE, USGS) as suitable for wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass energy production and b) compare these with areas of change-agent disturbance, intact native vegetation, conservation elements of concern, and ecological integrity to c) identify and map the geographic distribution of areas that would have that have the fewest environmental effects from renewable energy development. This raster addressed the SOW by combining three raster layers: Filtered direct normal solar resource data for the Southwest United States (National Renewable Energy Laboratories and SUNY Albany, 2010). This layer represents areas with less than 5 degrees slope that have potential for solar energy development. NatureServe landscape condition model, a continuous value raster reflecting modeled (or expected) landscape integrity based on change agent disturbance including invasive annual grass species. The raster contains values between 0-100, lower values representing lower landscape condition and higher values representing high condition. Summary of ecoregion landscape species (conservation elements) by 30m pixel. This species richness map simply shows the number of landscape species distribution in the ecoregion by pixel. Landscape species for the MBR include: Bald Eagle Big brown bat Brazilian free-tailed bat Desert big horn Brewer's Sparrow (Breeding) Brewer's Sparrow (Migratory) Common Kingsnake Coachwhip Cooper's hawk Desert Tortoise - Mohave Population Desert Tortoise - Sonoran Population Prairie Falcon Great Basin Collared Lizard Gila Monster Golden Eagle Glossy Snake Kit Fox Mule Deer Class B Summer Range Mule Deer Class D Winter Range Mule Deer Class F Year Round Range Mohave Rattlesnake Mojave Ground Squirrel Northern Harrier Northern Rubber Boa Northern Sagebrush Lizard Sage Sparrow Sage Thrasher Western Banded Gecko Western Patch-nosed Snake Please see metadata for these layers for additional information. Solar potential in terms of direct normal insolation is considered high enough in much of the ecoregion for commercial development. The limiting factor for solar energy development in the ecoregion is slope and most solar energy developers strongly prefer geographically flat areas for development. In this case this was defined as areas with less than 5 degrees slope based on NatureServe's experience mapping solar energy in the ecoregion, but this not based on any rigorous assessment of solar energy siting. This layer was intersected with the landscape condition raster and the landscape species summary. The landscape condition value was multiplied by the number of landscape species and the resulting value was normalized (a log transformation was applied in the case that the distribution was non-normal). Additional areas were removed that represent lakes, salt flats and areas where management tends to prioritize biodiversity protection (USGAP classes 1 & 2). While this simple assessment model would tend to indicate that there are lower scoring areas that are more appropriate for renewable energy development and higher scoring areas that should be avoided, this raster only represents distributions and knowledge acquired during the REA process and does not reflect field-verified energy potential, ground condition or the actual number of species potentially located at a site. It is also important to note that this does not factor in all conservation elements or particular elements (wetlands, endangered species) that should be taken into particular consideration regarding the siting of energy facilities." ;
