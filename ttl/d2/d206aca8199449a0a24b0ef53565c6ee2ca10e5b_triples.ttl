    dc:description "Ground water level elevations were collected every 10 to 15 days from piezometers stationed along three forest-marsh-tidal creek transects (B, C, and D) across the Crabhaul Creek basin in the North Inlet Estuary, Georgetown County, SC. At each station, a nest of three to five piezometers were installed at nominal depths (see Sections 2.1.1) of 0.6 (2ft), 1.2 (4ft), 2.4 (8ft), 3.6 (12ft) and 4.8 (16ft) meters. In all, there are 305 piezometers distributed over 73 stations. Transect B, at the head of Crabhaul Creek and the most southerly transect, is 147 meters long and has 18 nested piezometer stations while Transect D, the most northerly and seaward (closest to field lab), is 260 meters long and has 29 nested piezometer stations. In addition, a tide gauge was installed on Transect D in the channel of Crabhaul Creek at a distance of 93.6 meters (309 ft) from the northwest end of the transect. The intermediate transect, C, is 264 meters long and has 26 nested piezometer stations. The separation between nested piezometer stations along a transect ranged from 2.0 meters in the tidal channel to 37 meters in areas of little topographic and botanical variation. Near the forest-marsh boundary, where variations in both topography and botany are great, stations were spaced at 6.0 meter intervals. Data collection began March 16, 1994 and ceased May 2, 1996. Depending on the particular data logger in use, readings were taken at 10 to 15 minute intervals, but later all readings were interpolated to 15 minute intervals. In all, the total number of water-level measurements is on the order of 5,000,000 but these are not uniformly distributed over time or space due to the limited number of data loggers available (typically 20 four-channel instruments) and other logistical problems." ;
