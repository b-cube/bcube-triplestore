    dc:description "Estuarine ecosystems worldwide have suffered severe degradation due to modification of their upland watersheds for urban and/or agricultural development. Additionally, estuarine organisms already face one of the most rigorous of aquatic environments, with many species operating at or close to their physiological limits. This project develops priorities for management objectives of estuarine and adjacent upland wetlands by determining the relative influences of various aspects of environmental degradation on coastal landscapes. For example, the Everglades ecosystem has suffered extensive degradation over the past century, prompting the largest wetland restoration effort ever undertaken. Water flow to the Everglades and Florida Bay has been extensively modified by canals throughout the Everglades ecosystem; however, it is unclear how these modifications in timing and volume of freshwater release affect faunal communities. Although it is known that some faunal communities (i.e., wading birds, NE FL Bay fishes) have reduced diversity and/or density relative to historic (i.e., pre-drainage) conditions, the precise mechanisms driving these changes remain largely unknown. It is important to delineate the relative influences of a variety of drainage effects (i.e., changes to rate/timing of freshwater flow, changes in prey abundance/availability, changes in habitat abundance/availability, etc.) to determine which aspects of the present landscape are most important for mitigation. Because the Everglades and Florida Bay are one hydrologic unit, it is important to determine the effects of hydrologic changes on both upland (freshwater) and downstream (estuarine) communities to make appropriate management decisions." ;
